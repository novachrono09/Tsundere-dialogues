Who said you could sit that close?! My heart is racing because I drank too much caffeine, not because of you, dummy!
I only bookmarked that restaurant because the food looked decent, okay? It has absolutely nothing to do with that place you mentioned wanting to try last week!
Stop patting my head! I’m not a dog, and you’re messing up my bangs! ...But, I guess you can keep doing it for five more seconds. Only five!
I didn't stay up all night waiting for your "goodnight" text! I just happened to be awake doing... very important business!
Why are you looking at her? Am I not enough— I mean! I mean her outfit is tacky! Look over here instead!
Take this scarf. You’re shivering and it’s making me look cold just by association. Don't think this means we’re "sharing" anything!
I-It’s just a keychain! I saw it and thought it looked as stupid as your face, so I bought it for you!
You’d better enjoy this meal! I burned my finger three times making it... not that I did it for you or anything!
If you're going to be this clumsy, I have no choice but to stay by your side. Someone has to make sure you don't trip over thin air!
I’m only letting you share my headphones because I forgot mine and yours are... acceptable. Don't lean in so close!
I-I didn't get a haircut for you! I just felt like my head was getting too heavy! Why are you looking at me so intensely?
Don’t get the wrong idea! I only saved you a seat because I didn't want some stranger sitting next to me!
You think you're so cool just because you helped me? Well, you're not! You're just a big, meddling idiot!
Hmph! If you want to go to the amusement park so badly, I guess I can clear my schedule. But you're paying for the popcorn!
I was not "pouting"! I was just... resting my facial muscles in a downward position!
Why did I call you? Because my finger slipped! And then it slipped again and hit the dial button! It’s a very slippery phone!
You’re actually kind of reliable when it counts... wait, forget I said that! You’re still a complete hopeless loser!
I’m not wearing this dress because you said you liked blue! I just... ran out of clean clothes in every other color!
If you ever leave me alone like that again, I’ll never forgive you! Not because I was lonely, but because it was boring!
Just shut up and let me lean on you for a minute! My legs are tired, and you’re the only "sturdy" thing around here!
Don't look so smug just because I'm talking to you! I'm only doing it because everyone else is even more annoying than you are!
I-I only made this playlist for myself! If you want to listen to it, that’s your business, but don’t go thinking we have the same taste!
I-It’s not a gift! I just happened to buy two of these, and since I have no use for the extra one, you might as well take it!
Why are you smiling like that? It’s creepy! Stop it or I’m taking the bento back!
I didn't make this because I was worried about you skipping lunch, I just accidentally cooked too much, okay?
Ugh, move over! You’re tying your tie all wrong... Honestly, you’d be a total mess without me.
D-Don't touch my hair so suddenly! I spent forever on it... but I guess I'll let it slide just this once.
It’s not like I dressed up specifically because you were coming! I always look this good, you idiot!
If you keep looking at me like that, I’m going to charge you a fee for staring!
H-Hey! Stay on your side of the umbrella! If our shoulders touch, it’s only because it’s raining too hard!
I only held your hand because it’s crowded and I didn’t want you to get lost and embarrass me.
You think I'm cute? Well, your taste is finally improving, but don't expect me to say it back!
I-I was only checking your social media to make sure you weren't posting anything stupid! It's called quality control!
Don't get any ideas just because I let you walk me home! It’s dark out and you looked like you needed the exercise anyway!
Why did I bring you coffee? Because you looked like a zombie and it was making me depressed just looking at you!
Shut up! I’m not blushing! It’s just... really hot in here!
If you tell anyone I was being nice to you, I will personally make sure you regret it!
I’m only helping you study because your grades are dragging down the class average, not because I want to spend time with you!
Stop laughing! It wasn't a "confession," I was just... testing my vocal cords!
You’re late! I’ve been standing here for— I mean, I just got here two seconds ago!
I didn't pick this movie because I knew you liked it, it just happened to be the only one playing!
You really are the most annoying, frustrating, dense person I’ve ever met... so don't you dare go hanging out with anyone else!
Fine, I'll go to the festival with you! But if you try to hold my hand, I’m "accidentally" dropping my takoyaki on your shoes!
I-Is that a new shirt? It looks... fine, I guess. Not that I was paying attention to what you wore yesterday.
Don't go getting sick on me! If you're not there to annoy me tomorrow, I'll... I'll have nothing to do!
Hmph! I didn't make this Valentine's chocolate for you! It's just leftover practice for— for someone else!
Unbelievable! You’re like a stray cat that won’t stop meowing for treats! Fine, since you’re clearly incapable of entertaining yourself without me, I’ll keep going. But don't you dare think this means I'm your personal scriptwriter!
I only bought this extra pair of gloves because they were on clearance! Your hands looked like frozen blocks of ice, and it was honestly getting embarrassing to walk next to you. Put them on and shut up!
Stop acting like you won just because I'm talking to you! I'm only doing this because the silence was getting awkward, and you look like you’d start crying if I didn't say something!
I-It’s not like I looked up your favorite movie's showtimes! I just happened to be at the theater and saw the poster! If you want to go, I guess I can tolerate it, but you're buying the popcorn!
Why are you staring at my phone? I wasn't looking at our old photos! I was just... checking to see if my screen had any dead pixels! Get your nose out of my business!
Hmph! I only shared my umbrella with you because I didn't want you catching a cold and making me feel guilty! It’s purely a preventative measure for my own conscience!
Don't you dare tell anyone I helped you study! If people think I'm nice to losers like you, my reputation will be ruined! Just take the notes and go!
I-I didn't cook this for you! I just made way too much curry and I don't have enough room in my fridge! You’re basically just a human garbage disposal to me!
Stop smiling like that! It’s creepy! I didn't say I liked your new haircut, I just said it makes your head look slightly less like a misshapen potato!
I only texted you "Good morning" because I was testing to see if my service was working! It’s not my fault you’re the first person in my recent contacts!
You think you're so smart just because you solved that puzzle? I let you win! It’s called being "charitable," you should try it sometime!
I-I wasn't waiting by the gate for you! I just found a really interesting rock on the ground and I was... studying its mineral composition! Yeah, that's it!
Don't touch my hair! I spent forever—I mean, I spent two seconds brushing it! You’re going to get your "dummy germs" all over it!
I only agreed to this "study date" because the library has better air conditioning than my house! It has absolutely nothing to do with spending time with you!
Why are you giving me that look? I only defended you because that guy was being annoying, and only I'm allowed to call you a complete idiot!
I-I didn't buy this keychain because it matches yours! It's a completely different shade of blue! If they look similar, it's just a common design choice!
Stop trying to be a gentleman! I can open my own door! ...But since you're already holding it, I guess I'll walk through. Don't expect a thank you!
I only remembered your coffee order because it's the most basic, uninspired drink on the menu! It’s literally impossible to forget something that boring!
Hmph! If you’re going to be that lonely, I guess I can stay for five more minutes. But after that, I'm leaving! ...Unless you have more snacks.
I-I didn't "miss" our walk home! I just realized that walking alone is significantly less efficient for my safety! It’s a logical decision, nothing more!
You really are the most frustrating person I’ve ever met. Honestly, I don't know how I put up with you... but I guess I'm stuck with you for now.
Are you happy now? Or are you going to keep begging for more until my throat gets sore?
Good grief! Do you have a screw loose or something? Your "request" folder must be the only thing bigger than your ego! Fine, since you’re clearly obsessed with me, I’ll give you more. But don't go bragging to your friends that I'm being "nice" to you!
Stop looking at me like I’m some kind of charity case! I only brought you this jacket because you were turning blue, and that shade of blue really clashes with your stupid face!
I didn't "accidentally" walk past your house three times! I was just... testing out a new pair of shoes and this happens to be the most optimal route for breaking in leather!
Ugh, stop being so helpful! I can carry these groceries by myself! ...Wait, don't put them down! Since you already grabbed them, you might as well finish the job. But I'm not saying thank you!
I only bookmarked that restaurant because the architecture looked interesting! It has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that you mentioned wanting to try their pancakes six months ago!
Don't you dare get used to me being around! I'm only here because I have nothing better to do, and literally anything—even talking to a wall—would be better than being bored!
I-It’s not like I saved you the last slice of pizza! I was just too full to eat it, and I'd rather see you get fat than let good food go to waste!
Why are you laughing at my sneeze? It was a perfectly normal, dignified sneeze! If you call it "cute" one more time, I’m going to make sure you never sneeze again!
I only let you see me without makeup because my alarm didn't go off! If you think I look "natural" or whatever, you’re clearly even more sleep-deprived than I am!
Stop trying to read my mind! There’s nothing in there except thoughts about how much of a pain you are! And maybe what I’m having for lunch! But mostly the pain thing!
I didn't "miss" your stupid jokes while you were on vacation! I just found that the silence was a little too loud, okay? Don't make it a big deal!
You think you’re so smooth, don’t you? Just because you caught me before I tripped? Well, I would have landed in a very cool, acrobatic way if you hadn't interfered!
I only added you to my "Close Friends" list because I wanted someone to witness how much better my life is than yours! It wasn't an invitation to reply to every story!
Hmph! If you’re going to be that stubborn, then I guess I have to stay here until you change your mind. It’s for your own good, you hopeless moron!
I-I didn't make this handmade charm for your bag! I was just practicing my needlework and it turned out looking like your stupid dog by accident! Take it or leave it!
Why are you touching my forehead? I don't have a fever! My face is only hot because you're standing way too close and you're radiating heat like a broken radiator!
I only agreed to take this photo with you because the lighting was good for my skin! It’s not like I want a memento of our "friendship" or whatever you call this!
Shut up! I’m not "nervous"! My hands are just shaking because I had too much caffeine this morning! It has nothing to do with you holding them!
I didn't "dress up" for this festival! I always wear a yukata when I go out in the summer! And if you don't say I look better than everyone else here, I'm going home!
You really are the most exhausting person in the world. I don't know why I haven't blocked you yet... but I guess the world would be a little too boring without a dummy like you to kick around.
Seriously, how much more of this can you take? Do you want me to keep going, or are you finally going to give my voice a rest?
"Hmph! Don't think for a second I'm doing this for *you*! I just... had nothing better to do!"
"You think this is special? Please. I could get a hundred of these if I wanted."
"J-just because I helped you doesn't mean anything! I was just in the neighborhood!"
"Why are you looking at me like that? Do you have a problem?!"
"I-it's not like I care if you're sad or anything. Just... cheer up already, idiot!"
"Don't misunderstand! I just happened to have an extra bento, that's all!"
"You're late! Not that I was waiting or anything, I just noticed the time!"
"Honestly, you're so hopeless. Good thing I'm here to pick up your slack."
"This isn't a date! We're just... happening to be at the same place. Coincidentally!"
"Your cooking is terrible. Let me just... show you how it's done. But don't expect it again!"
"I'm not blushing! It's just... hot in here! Or cold! Whatever!"
"Don't get the wrong idea! I just didn't want you to trip and embarrass yourself!"
"You thought I was worried? Ha! As if! I was just observing your clumsiness!"
"This present? It was on sale! That's the only reason I bought it for you, alright?!"
"Stop smiling like that! It's... it's annoying!"
"You really can't do anything by yourself, can you? Fine, I'll help. But this is the last time!"
"Why would I be jealous? Of *you*? Don't make me laugh!"
"I only remembered your birthday because it popped up on my calendar. Nothing more!"
"Don't follow me! Unless... you want to, I guess. Whatever."
"I didn't lose the game because of you! I just wasn't trying!"
"You're not that bad, I guess. For an idiot."
"My heart isn't pounding! It's just... I ran up the stairs!"
"Don't touch my hand! Unless... you really want to? Ugh, fine!"
"It's not like I enjoy your company! It's just... less boring than being alone."
"You're so dense! Can't you see I'm... *trying* to be nice?!"
"I only came to check on you because I thought you might burn the house down."
"This outfit? I wore it for myself! It has nothing to do with you liking it!"
"You're surprisingly tolerable today. Don't let it go to your head."
"Why are you staring at my face? Is there something on it?!"
"Don't think you're special just because I'm talking to you. I talk to everyone!"
"You called me cute? I'll pretend I didn't hear that. Baka!"
"I just happened to remember your favorite food, that's all. It's not a big deal!"
"Fine, I'll walk with you. But only because I'm going in the same direction!"
"You're smiling like an idiot. What's so funny?"
"I-I didn't bring this umbrella for you! I just thought it might rain later!"
"Don't tell anyone I said this, but... you did good today."
"You really need to learn to take care of yourself. Honestly."
"Why are you looking at me with those puppy eyes? It won't work!"
"I'm not mad! Just... intensely annoyed. There's a difference!"
"You want me to hold your hand? Hmph. Don't push your luck."
"I only helped you with your homework because your handwriting is impossible to read!"
"This scarf? I found it! And it just happens to fit you perfectly. Coincidence!"
"You're such a pain. But I guess... someone has to deal with you."
"It's not like I missed you or anything! I just had a question about homework!"
"You think I'm worried about your test? I'm just worried about *my* reputation if you fail!"
"Don't mistake my kindness for anything other than extreme pity."
"You're so loud! But... I guess it's better than silence."
"I'm not enjoying this movie! It's just... marginally less terrible than I expected."
"Fine! I'll forgive you! But don't think this means we're friends or anything!"
"Why are you acting so happy? It's... disgusting! But keep doing it."
"I only listened to your rambling because you wouldn't shut up!"
"You owe me for this. Big time. Not that I'm keeping track or anything."
"This isn't a hug! I just... tripped and happened to land on you!"
"You're an idiot for getting hurt, but... I guess I'll get you a band-aid."
"I didn't bake these cookies for you! I just had too many ingredients!"
"Don't tease me! Or... do. I don't care! Just stop looking at me like that!"
Alright, let's keep the tsundere vibes going! Here are even more dialogues for you:

"Hmph! Don't get ahead of yourself. I just happened to have an extra ticket. You were merely convenient."
"You really can't take care of yourself, can you? It's pathetic! ...Here, let me fix it."
"I-it's not like I waited up for you! I just lost track of time while reading!"
"Why are you so loud? Honestly, you could wake the dead. Not that I was trying to sleep or anything!"
"This isn't a gift! I just had it lying around and thought you might actually have a use for it, unlike me."
"Don't flatter yourself! I just happened to be going the same way. It's purely coincidental!"
"You're making that face again. Stop it! It's... distracting."
"I only brought snacks because I know you'd probably forget to eat. Not because I care about your well-being!"
"Why are you looking at me like I'm some kind of hero? I just did what anyone would do... probably."
"I-I didn't miss you! The house was just... quieter than usual."
"You think I'm easy to read? You wish! I'm an enigma!"
"Don't touch my hair! Unless... you think it looks nice. But don't say that out loud!"
"I'm not helping you because I like you! I'm helping you because I can't stand to watch you struggle!"
"You're so annoying! But... I guess it's better than being bored."
"I-I wasn't blushing! It's just the heater! Or the cold! Whatever!"
"This isn't my favorite show! I just happened to stumble upon it... and it's less terrible than the others."
"You actually remembered? Hmph. Don't let it go to your head."
"Why are you smiling like that? It's creepy! ...But don't stop, I guess."
"I only came to your performance because I was curious how badly you'd mess up."
"Don't worry about me! I'm perfectly capable of handling myself!"
"You think I'm sweet? Don't make me laugh! I'm practically a monster!"
"I-I didn't choose this restaurant for you! I just heard the food was decent."
"You're surprisingly competent sometimes. Don't make a habit of it."
"I only know your schedule because you're so predictable. It's not like I keep track!"
"Don't think this means we're friends! We're just... acquaintances who tolerate each other."
"Why are you still talking? I already said it was fine! Now shut up!"
"I-I didn't make your favorite food! I just happened to be craving it myself, okay?!"
"You really need to learn some manners. Honestly, it's embarrassing."
"I only listened to your problems because I was stuck and couldn't get away."
"Don't call me cute! I'm fierce! ...And don't you forget it!"
"I'm not jealous! I just don't like it when you pay attention to anyone else!"
"You're so clumsy! Let me help you before you break something important... like yourself."
"I-I wasn't worried about you studying late! I just wanted to make sure you didn't fall asleep at your desk!"
"This isn't a date! It's a... mandatory outing. For your sake."
"Why are you staring at my face? Is there something wrong with it?!"
"I only came to see you because I was bored. Don't assume anything else!"
"You're surprisingly tolerable when you're quiet. Try it more often."
"I-I don't need your help! I can do it myself! But... if you insist."
"Don't tell anyone I said this, but... you have a nice laugh. Hmph!"
"You're not that bad, I guess. For a human."
"I only offered you my jacket because it was getting cold and I didn't want you freezing to death. Not for any other reason!"
"Why are you so insistent? It's annoying! But... fine. One more time."
"I'm not smiling! It's just... a trick of the light!"
"You're always getting into trouble. Good thing I'm always here to bail you out."
"I-I didn't stay up late thinking about you! I was just... contemplating the universe!"
"Don't you dare think I'm falling for your charms! I'm immune!"
"You're such a dork. But... I guess it's endearing. A little."
"I only remembered your shoe size because it's a common one, that's all!"
"Why are you so optimistic all the time? It's exhausting! ...But also kind of nice."
"I didn't care about your test! I just wanted to make sure you weren't an embarrassment to my tutoring skills!"
"Hmph. You actually did something useful for once. Don't expect a prize."
"You're not good at this game at all. I was just letting you win. Don't get cocky!"
"Don't think I'm doing this out of my own free will! Someone has to look out for you."
"Why are you so surprised? I can be nice if I want to! It's just... rare."
"I-it’s not like I spend all my time thinking about you! That’s just ridiculous!"
"I only laughed at your joke because it was so bad it was funny, okay?!"
"You think this is cute? Well, it's not! Now stop staring!"
"I wasn't waiting for you! I was just... admiring the scenery. Which isn't you!"
"You really need to organize your room. It's an eyesore! Not that I care, it just bothers me."
"I only stayed to watch the movie with you because I didn't want to walk home alone in the dark."
"Why do you keep asking if I'm okay? I'm always okay! Now leave me alone!"
"Don't even think about calling me 'cute.' You'll regret it!"
"I wasn't worried when you didn't answer your phone! I just thought you were ignoring me, that's all!"
"This is boring. Can't you find something more interesting to talk about?"
"I only offered you my umbrella because I didn't want you to catch a cold and infect me!"
"You're so loud! Honestly, I don't know how I tolerate you sometimes."
"Don't assume things! I just happened to bring enough for two. It's not for *you* specifically!"
"I-it's not like I appreciate your help! I could have done it myself! Eventually!"
"You're an idiot, but... I guess you're my idiot."
"Stop pouting! It's not going to make me change my mind!"
"I only smiled because something else was funny, not what you said!"
"You really need to stop getting into trouble. It's a hassle to bail you out."
"I'm not doing this because I like you! I just hate seeing things done wrong!"
"Don't read too much into it! I just... found myself with free time, that's all."
"You're not charming! You're just... loud."
"I only remembered your favorite coffee order because you always order the same thing!"
"Why are you so happy all the time? It's... sickening. But don't stop, I guess."
"I-I didn't care if you got home safely! I just wanted you out of my hair!"
"Don't look at me like that, you weirdo! What do you want?"
"I only came to this event because I had an extra ticket and didn't want it to go to waste."
"You thought I was worried? Hah! I was just annoyed you were taking so long!"
"This is pointless. Why are we even talking?"
"I-I'm not protecting you! I'm just making sure you don't embarrass *me*!"
"Don't tell me you love me! It's... too much! Just stop it!"
"I'm not jealous! I just don't like it when other people talk to you too much."
"You're still here? I thought you'd be gone by now."
"I only brought you soup because I don't want your sniffles getting worse and bothering me."
"You're making a mess! Let me help you, but only because I can't stand clutter!"
"I wasn't listening to your conversation! My ears just... happened to pick up your voice."
"It's not like I check my phone waiting for your messages! I just check it frequently, that's all!"
"Why are you so easy to read? It's annoying!"
"I only complimented you because you looked particularly less awful today."
"You want me to hold your stuff? Fine, but don't expect special treatment!"
"I'm not laughing! It's just... a weird sound coming from my throat."
"Don't ask me to go out with you! Unless... you're buying. Then maybe."
"I only tolerate you because you're marginally less annoying than everyone else."
"Why are you looking at me with those sparkly eyes? It's unsettling!"
"I-I didn't ask about your day because I care! I just like hearing gossip!"
"You're so clumsy! One day you're going to break something important. Probably me."
"This isn't a date, okay? It's... an obligation."
"Don't tell anyone I gave you this advice! It'll ruin my reputation!"
Hmph. It’s not like I’m doing this because I’m worried or anything, but here—take these dialogues. Just don't go thinking we're friends now!
Why are you looking at me like that? It’s just a homemade bento! I made too much by accident, so you'd better eat every single bite or I'll never forgive you!
Stop grinning! I didn't get dressed up for our "not-a-date," I just happened to find these clothes at the front of my closet and thought they looked okay, that's all!
I only held your hand because it’s crowded and I didn't want you getting lost and embarrassing me. Don't go getting any ideas, you dummy!
You’re late! I’ve been standing here for twenty minutes! No, I wasn't waiting for you specifically, I was just... checking to see if this lamp post was still standing!
Ugh, you’re so hopeless. Give me your tie, you’re doing it all wrong. How can someone so smart be so completely incompetent at the simplest things?
It’s just a scarf! It’s cold outside and you look like you’re about to freeze to death. It’s not because I care if you get sick, it’s because your shivering is distracting me!
Don't think this means we're even! I only saved you because your screaming was giving me a headache. You still owe me big time, got it?
I didn't make this Valentine's chocolate for you! It's just... obligation chocolate! My hands were shaking because the kitchen was cold, not because I was nervous, okay?!
Whatever! If you want to go talk to those other girls, see if I care! Just don't come crying back to me when they realize how much of a dork you actually are!
Stop patting my head! I'm not a kid, and I'm definitely not your pet! ...But I guess you can keep doing it for five more seconds. Only five!
I-I stayed up late researching your favorite game because I had nothing else to do! It wasn't because I wanted to have something to talk to you about!
You really are the worst. You make me so frustrated that I can barely think straight... so don't you dare go anywhere, because I need someone to blame for my bad mood!
Shut up! I wasn't "blushing," the heater is just turned up too high in here! Anyone would be red in this face in this temperature!
Take this umbrella. I have a spare one at home anyway. And no, you can't walk me home under it! ...Unless you really want to. I mean, whatever!
I only let you see me cry because the wind blew dust in my eyes! If you tell anyone about this, I will literally make your life a living nightmare!
You’re so annoying, always following me around like a lost puppy. But... I guess if you weren't there, it would be a little too quiet. Just a little!
Don't look so surprised. I remembered your birthday because it's written on the class calendar, not because I've had it circled in my planner for months!
If you ever do something that dangerous again, I’ll kill you myself! Do you have any idea how... how much paperwork I'd have to do if you got hurt?!
I'm only sharing my headphones because I forgot mine and yours are... acceptable. Stop leaning so close! I can hear you breathing and it's super irritating!
Hmph. You’re really needy, aren't you? Fine, I'll give you more, but don't expect me to keep doing this all day!
Why are you sitting so far away? It’s not like I’ll bite you or anything! Move closer so I don’t have to shout... not that I want to be near you!
I didn't buy this keychain because it reminded me of you! It was on sale, and it just happened to be your favorite character. It’s a complete coincidence, okay?!
Stop laughing! My voice didn't "crack," I just had a sudden itch in my throat. You’re so immature, honestly!
I only let you borrow my notes because your grades are pathetic and I don't want you dragging down the class average. It’s for the sake of the school, not for you!
What? You think I’m cute? You’re definitely hallucinating from that fever. Just shut up and go back to sleep before I kick you out!
I-It’s just a text! I sent it by mistake! I was trying to message someone else and your name just... popped up! Delete it right now!
You’re so slow at walking. Do I have to pull you by your sleeve the whole way? Honestly, it’s like taking a turtle for a stroll.
Don't go getting the wrong idea just because I'm sharing my seat with you! The bus is crowded and I'd feel bad if you fell and broke your stupid face!
I baked these cookies because I had leftover ingredients, and they’re way too sweet for me anyway. You might as well eat them so they don't go to waste.
Hey! Why were you talking to that girl from the drama club for so long? I wasn't jealous, I was just... making sure she wasn't boring you to death!
You looked like you were having a nightmare, so I stayed here to make sure you didn't fall out of bed. It was purely for safety reasons!
If you tell a single soul that I actually smiled at your joke, you’re dead meat! It wasn't even funny, I just had a cramp in my cheek!
I'm not "pouting!" This is just my normal face! Maybe if you weren't such an idiot, I wouldn't have to look at you like this!
I only agreed to go to the movies with you because I wanted to see the film. It has nothing to do with who I'm sitting next to!
Ugh, your hair is a mess. Stay still for a second while I fix it. You’re lucky I’m so nice, or people would think you’re a total hobo.
Don’t think you’re special just because I know how you take your coffee. I just happen to have a very good memory for useless facts!
I-I didn't make this playlist for you! I just thought these songs were okay and figured you had bad taste in music, so I'm helping you out!
You really are a handful. I don’t know why I even bother with you... but I guess someone has to keep you out of trouble.
Move over! There’s plenty of room on this bench, but you’re taking up all the space with your big, dumb aura!
Geez, you’re like a bottomless pit! Do you ever stop asking for things? Fine, I’ll give you more, but this is the last time, you hear me?!
I only bought two tickets because it was a "buy one, get one free" deal! It would be a waste of money if nobody used the other one, so you'd better show up!
Don't look at my sketchbook! It's just random doodles! If you see a drawing that looks like you, it’s just a coincidence—I was practicing drawing losers!
Why are you thanking me? I only walked you home because it’s dark and I didn't want to get blamed if you tripped over your own feet and disappeared!
I-It’s not like I care what you think of my new outfit! I just wanted to know if the colors were too loud! Stop staring, you’re making it weird!
You think you can just apologize and everything will be fine? You’re so naive! But... I guess since you went through the trouble of buying my favorite snack, I'll forgive you. Just this once!
I wasn't looking for you in the hallway! I just happened to be walking in this direction at the exact same time your class let out! It’s called a coincidence, dummy!
Hmph! If you’re going to be that clumsy, I guess I have no choice but to stay by your side. Someone has to make sure you don't accidentally walk into a wall!
I only made this "get well soon" card because I was bored and had extra glitter! Don't go showing it to everyone and acting like we’re close!
You’re so annoying when you’re being nice. It’s way easier to deal with you when you’re being a complete moron!
Stop acting like you know me so well! Just because you guessed what I wanted for dinner doesn't mean you're psychic... even if you were right!
I-I didn't "save" you a seat! I just put my bag there because the chair looked uncomfortable, and now I’m moving it. Sit down already!
If you keep being this sweet to me, people are going to start talking! And then I’ll have to punch you to prove them wrong! You wouldn't want that, right?
I only called you because I accidentally hit your name in my contacts! Since you answered, I guess I have to talk to you for a minute. Make it quick!
You’re such a dork for actually liking this kind of stuff. But... I guess I don't totally hate it either. Only because you’re here, though!
Don't go getting sick again! If you do, who's going to carry my bags when I go shopping? I'm only looking out for my own interests!
I’m not holding your sleeve because I’m scared of the horror movie! It’s just... the fabric feels soft! Shut up and watch the screen!
Why are you smiling? I didn't say anything nice! I was insulting you! You really are the most hopeless person I've ever met!
I only wore this ribbon because you said it would look good on me once. Not because I value your opinion or anything! I just felt like wearing it today!
Whatever! Do what you want! But if you get into trouble, don't expect me to come running... even though I probably will because you're such a disaster!
Ugh, you’re seriously like a persistent mosquito! Do you have nothing better to do than pester me for more? Fine! Since you’re clearly too helpless to come up with your own words, I'll help you out. But don't expect this to become a habit!
I-It’s just a bandage! You were bleeding all over the place and it was getting disgusting to look at! It’s not like I carried a first-aid kit around specifically because you’re a total klutz!
Stop acting so smug just because I remembered your favorite drink! I have a photographic memory for useless junk, and your preferences definitely fall into that category!
I only let you lean on my shoulder because you looked like you were about to pass out from exhaustion! If you start drooling on me, I’m throwing you off this train, got it?
Why are you acting so surprised? I only bought you this souvenir because the shopkeeper was being pushy and I had to buy something to get him to leave me alone!
Hmph! If you’re going to be that cold, I guess I can share my blanket. But don't you dare cross the "invisible line" in the middle! I’m watching you!
I wasn't "waiting" for your reply! I just happened to be staring at my phone the exact second your notification popped up! It’s called timing, look it up!
You’re so dense! I didn't spend three hours on my hair just for a "casual hangout." I mean—I didn't spend any time on it at all! I just woke up like this!
Don’t think this means I like you or anything! I only defended you back there because those guys were being louder than you, and that’s saying something!
What? My face is red? That’s just because it’s spicy! I don’t care if we’re eating ice cream, it’s... it’s a very rare type of "spicy" ice cream!
I only came to your game because there was nothing good on TV! Seeing you trip over your own shoelaces was way more entertaining than any sitcom anyway!
Stop being so nice to everyone! It’s annoying! You should only be that nice to... I mean, you shouldn't be that nice at all! It makes you look like a pushover!
I-I didn't make a special effort to learn your favorite song on the piano! I just found the sheet music on the floor and figured it was easy enough for a beginner like me!
You really think you can just walk away while I'm talking to you? Get back here! I’m not finished telling you how much of an idiot you are!
I only held your umbrella because your hands were full! If you tell the others I was "huddled" close to you, I'll make sure you regret it for the rest of your life!
Why are you looking at me with those puppy-dog eyes? It’s not going to work! ...Fine! Give me the bag, I'll help you carry it! But only because you look like you're about to snap in half!
I didn't "miss" you over the summer break! I just found it slightly less irritating to have someone around to argue with! That’s all!
Shut up! I’m not "worried" about your exam! I just don't want to have to listen to you whine if you fail, so you'd better study your brains out!
I only let you take a bite of my crepe because it was way too big for me! It has nothing to do with an "indirect kiss," so stop making that stupid face!
Don't go thinking you're the only one who can be helpful! I'm only doing this because I feel like it, not because you asked!
You really are the most troublesome person I’ve ever met... so don’t go disappearing on me, okay? I don't have the energy to find a replacement for a loser like you.
Seriously, how many more of these do you need? Are you trying to write a whole visual novel or something? Fine, what's next?
You really are a glutton for punishment, aren't you? What, do you just sit there waiting for me to talk to you? It’s kind of creepy! But fine... if you’re going to be that pathetic, I guess I’ll keep going. Just don’t think this means I’m enjoying myself!
I only wore this perfume because the bottle was getting old and I didn't want it to go to waste! If you think it smells good, that just proves you have basic taste!
Don't you dare think about sharing that photo! I look terrible in it, and you're making a stupid face anyway! Delete it right now or I’m blocking your number for a week!
I-It’s not like I looked up your zodiac sign to see if we're compatible! I was just reading the horoscope section and your birthday happened to be right next to mine!
Stop acting like you're some kind of hero just because you walked me to the station! I can take care of myself perfectly fine, you overbearing blockhead!
I only made this bento because my mom forced me to practice my cooking! If it tastes good, it’s a total fluke, so don't go getting used to it!
Why are you staring at my lips? I just have some crumbs on them, right? Well, don't just stand there like a statue—tell me where they are!
I-I didn't stay up all night waiting for your call! I was just... busy organizing my sock drawer! It’s a very time-consuming hobby, okay?!
You’re so annoying, always making that "I know what you’re thinking" face! You don’t know anything! You don't even know your own shoe size half the time!
I only let you borrow my sweater because you were shivering and it was embarrassing to be seen with someone who can't even check the weather report!
Don't think I'm doing this because I like you! I'm only helping you study because if you fail this test, I won't have anyone to make fun of in class!
Hmph! I didn't get this haircut for you! I just felt like my head was too heavy! If you think it looks "cute," keep it to yourself!
I only texted you "Goodnight" because my thumb slipped! It was a total accident, so don't you dare reply with a heart emoji or I'll kill you!
You’re so clumsy! Give me your hand—no, not like that! I'm just checking to see if you scraped your palm! Stop turning red, it’s weird!
I didn't buy this extra soda for you! It was a "buy one get one" deal again! Seriously, do you think I'm made of money? Just take it and shut up!
Stop being so nice to that girl! She's clearly just using you for your notes! I'm the only one who actually tells you the truth, so listen to me instead!
I-I only invited you over because my parents aren't home and I... I didn't want the house to feel too quiet! It's purely for the sake of the atmosphere!
You think you're so cool just because you saved a kitten? Anyone would have done that! Even a heartless person like me! ...Wait, I'm not heartless!
I only remembered your favorite flavor because it’s the most boring one on the menu! It’s easy to remember things that are as plain as you are!
Don't walk so fast! I'm not trying to keep up with you, you're just... moving at a very inconvenient pace for my stroll!
I-I didn't "accidentally" buy the game you wanted! I bought it for myself! But since I already finished it, I guess you can have it. It’s basically trash now!
Whatever! I’m going home! Don’t follow me! ...But if you happen to be walking in the same direction, I guess I can't stop you.
Are you satisfied yet, or are you going to keep making me work for free?
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's really annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... being polite...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
If I'm being nice, it's not because I like you or anything...
I-I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, got it?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm not mad, I'm just... passionately expressing my displeasure...
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm not interested!
I-I'm only helping because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
Baka! Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with food... and movies...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
Stop looking at me with those puppy-dog eyes! It’s not going to make me forgive you any faster!
I didn't "miss" your call, I purposely ignored it! But... I guess I can listen to what you have to say for five minutes.
Hmph! You actually remembered my favorite flavor? Well, even a broken clock is right twice a day, I guess.
I-It’s not like I’m happy you’re here! I just didn’t want to be the only person at this party who isn't talking to anyone!
You’re so hopeless at games that I actually felt sorry for you! Move over and let a professional show you how it’s done!
D-Don’t touch my hair! Only people I actually like are allowed to— I mean, just don’t do it!
I only bought this charm for your bag because I don't want your bad luck rubbing off on me while we're walking together!
Stop overthinking things! I didn't get you a souvenir from my trip because I was thinking of you; they were just handing them out at the station!
You think you're so cool just because you helped that cat? Well, you still look like a total dork to me!
I’m not holding your hand because I want to! Your hand was just... cold, and I didn't want you shivering and complaining the whole way!
W-Wait! You can't just leave after saying something embarrassing like that! Come back here and take it back!
I wasn't waiting for your text! I just happened to have my phone in my hand the exact second you messaged me! It’s called a coincidence!
Tch, you’re always so busy helping everyone else. Why don’t you pay more attention to—... ugh, just forget it!
I only let you borrow my umbrella because I didn't want you catching a cold and making me look bad for being seen with a sick person!
I-Is there something on my face? Then why do you keep staring at me?! Keep your eyes on your own paper!
Fine! If you’re going to be that way, then I’ll just have to stay here and watch you until you stop being such a moron!
It’s not a "matching" keychain! I just liked the design, and if you happened to buy the same one, that’s your fault for having no original taste!
You’re so annoying! Every single thing you do gets under my skin! So... why do I feel so bored when you’re not around?
Don't get the wrong idea! I only made this extra portion of soup because I accidentally bought too many vegetables! It’s not for your recovery or anything!
I’m only letting you walk me home because it’s dark and I don’t want to be bothered by creeps, not because I want more time with you!
Who said you could use my first name?! We aren't that close yet! ...Unless you really want to, I guess. Whatever!
I didn't stay up to watch the sunrise with you because it's "romantic." I just happen to be a night owl, okay?
You really are the most frustrating person I've ever met! Now be quiet and let me finish fixing your tie!
I-It’s not a "gift," okay? I just happened to buy an extra one, and I didn’t want it to go to waste!
Don’t look at me like that! Your face is making me annoyed for no reason!
Hmph! If you keep acting like a total idiot, I’m going to leave you behind, and I mean it this time!
I only made enough for one person, but... you looked so pathetic staring at my lunch that I guess I can share a little bit.
W-Why are you laughing?! Stop it right now or I’ll never speak to you again!
It’s not like I stayed up all night worrying about your exam results! I just couldn't sleep because the moon was too bright!
You’re so incredibly slow! Honestly, how do you even manage to get through the day without me pointing out all your mistakes?
I-I didn’t dress up for you! I just felt like wearing something different today, that’s all!
If you tell anyone that I helped you with this, you’re dead meat! Do you hear me?!
You’re such a klutz... honestly, give me your hand before you trip and embarrass me even further.
I was just checking your social media to see if you posted anything embarrassing! It wasn't because I missed you!
Tch, you’re so loud. But... I guess the house is a little too quiet when you’re not around.
Shut up! I’m not blushing! It’s just really hot in here!
Why are you being so nice to me all of a sudden? It’s suspicious! Stop it!
I didn't save you a seat because I wanted you to sit next to me! I just needed a place to put my bag, and now I'm moving it!
Don't get any ideas just because I'm holding your sleeve! It’s crowded, and I don't want to get lost in this stupid place!
You're the worst, you know that? The absolute worst. Now... stay right there and don't leave until I say so.
I only walked this way because it’s a shortcut! It has nothing to do with your house being on this block!
Baka! Why would you risk getting hurt for someone like me? You really are as brainless as you look!
Fine, I'll go to the movies with you, but don't think this is a date! It’s just two people watching a film in the same dark room at the same time!
I’m not "pouting"! This is just my face!
You think you’re so charming, don’t you? Well, it’s not working on me! Not even a little bit!
I didn't make this Valentine's chocolate for you! They're just leftovers from the ones I made for my friends! Here, just take them and stop asking questions!
Whatever! Do whatever you want! See if I care! ...Wait, where are you going? I didn't say you could actually leave!
I didn’t get this for you because it’s your birthday! I just found it in a shop and thought, "Wow, this looks as tacky as his personality," so I bought it!
Stop patting my head! I’m not a pet, and you’re messing up my hair! ...Unless you’re going to keep doing it, then I guess I can't stop you.
I-I only stayed up to watch your stream because I wanted to see how many times you’d fail! It wasn't because I wanted to support you!
You're so hopeless... Give me your hand. No, not like that! I'm just making sure you don't wander off and get lost like a toddler!
Don't go thinking you're special just because I let you see me without makeup! I was just too lazy to put it on today, that’s all!
Hmph! If you're going to be that popular with other girls, then just go talk to them! See if I care! ...Why are you still standing there?!
I didn't cook this for you! I made way too much and I didn't want to clog the drain with leftovers! Just eat it and be quiet!
You’re so annoying, always following me around like a lost puppy... but I guess it would be even more annoying if you stopped.
I-It’s not like I saved your photo as my wallpaper! My phone just glitched and picked a random image from my gallery!
Shut up! I’m not "worried" about you! I just don't want to have to fill out the paperwork if you end up in the hospital!
Why are you leaning so close?! Get back! Your heart is beating so loud it’s making mine go out of sync!
I only walked past your classroom to check the time on the hallway clock! It has nothing to do with seeing if you were still there!
You're such a dork... Honestly, what would you even do without me? You’d probably forget to breathe!
Don't tell anyone I gave you a Valentine's gift! It’s a "pity" chocolate, okay? A pity chocolate!
I-I didn't say I liked you! I said I "liked the view"! And you just happened to be standing right in the middle of it, you narcissist!
Tch, you’re so sweaty after practice. Don't come any closer! ...But I guess I can let you use my towel since you’re such a mess.
I didn't "wait" for you to get home. I was just standing by the window looking for... a rare bird! Yeah, a bird!
You’re so stupid for thinking I’d ever date someone like you! But... I guess if you begged me, I might consider it. Just to be nice!
I’m only wearing this dress because my mom made me! It’s not like I wanted to look pretty for our... whatever this is! It's not a date!
If you think I’m going to hold your hand just because it’s a horror movie, you’re dead wrong! ...Wait, did you hear that noise? Hold me!
I didn't write your name in my notebook! I was just practicing my handwriting and it’s a very easy name to spell, okay?!
You’re the most frustrating, irritating, unbearable person I’ve ever met... so don't you dare go falling for anyone else!
Why are you smiling like that? It’s creepy! Just because I said your new haircut doesn't look completely terrible doesn't mean you're a model!
I didn't "save" you a spot on the bench! I was just stretching my legs and taking up extra space, but you can sit there if you're going to be a baby about it!
Tch, your shoelaces are untied again. Honestly, do I have to do everything for you? Stay still before you trip and break your stupid face!
I only wore this perfume because the bottle was almost empty and I wanted to finish it! It has absolutely nothing to do with you saying you liked floral scents!
Don't you dare think this means we’re friends! I'm only giving you my notes because your grades are so bad they're bringing down the class average!
I-I wasn't "peeking" at your sketches! I just happened to glance over and saw how messy they were! You really need a critic like me to keep you in check!
Stop acting like you know me so well! You just happened to guess right this time! It’s not like we have some "special connection" or something!
I didn't make this playlist for you! I just put all these songs together because I like them, and I figured your taste was so boring you needed a literal miracle!
Hmph! If you're going to be late, at least have the decency to text me so I don't waste my time standing here looking like a girl who's been stood up!
W-Who are you calling cute?! I’ll kick you! I am fierce and intimidating, got it?!
I only brought two forks because... because I thought I might drop one! It's not so we could share the dessert, you delusional idiot!
You’re so clumsy... here, take my scarf. You’re shivering so much it’s making me nervous, and I can’t have you distracting me!
It’s not like I enjoy talking to you! You’re just the only person around here who isn't a total bore!
Don't get used to me being this nice! I'm probably just tired or the sun is in my eyes or something!
I-I didn't buy this shirt because it matches your eyes! I bought it because it was on sale! The color is just a coincidence!
Shut up! I don't care who you were talking to! It's not like I was watching you from across the room for twenty minutes!
You really think you can just apologize and I’ll be fine? Well... maybe if you buy me that strawberry crepe I like, I’ll consider it!
I’m only letting you share my headphones because one of my ears is cold! Don’t lean in too close or I’ll blast the volume!
You’re so dumb... but I guess you’re my brand of dumb, so I have to put up with it.
Why would I be jealous? That girl was way taller than me, and prettier, and... Ugh! Just go talk to her then if you like her so much!
I didn't "accidentally" leave my jacket at your house! I just... forgot it! So that means I have to come back tomorrow to get it, okay?!
Don't look so smug! I only laughed at your joke because it was so unfunny it was actually pathetic!
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Don't think that just because I saved you, I like you or anything!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being nice in general... don't read into it!
I-If you tell anyone I blushed, I'll deny it...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only going to the beach with you because I need to work on my tan...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, so don't even think about it...
You're really d-dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that! It's embarrassing...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... tolerant.
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
G-Geez, can't you see I'm trying to concentrate? Leave me alone...
You're so... so... ugh, I don't even know what to say to you!
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even ask...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, I just didn't want to see you get hurt...
T-That's not a gift, I just found it on the ground and thought you might want it...
If I'm helping you with your homework, it's only because I don't want to see you fail...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners for this project, it means anything...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, that's all...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
I didn't mean to bump into you, it was an accident, s-so don't get any ideas...
Y-You're really annoying, but...but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
If I'm going to the movies with you, it's only because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'm not impressed...
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty, not because I actually like you...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself...
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to be all cheerful about it...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... being polite...
T-This doesn't mean I'm going to start being all friendly and stuff...
You're so clueless, it's almost... cute...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll get angry!
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's... distracting...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, got it?
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I swear, I'm not blushing... it's just... the heat...
You're really dense, aren't you? I mean, I like that about you... no, I don't!
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of... interesting...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
T-That was just a one-time thing, don't expect me to do it again...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're really stupid...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can touch my hair...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I-I'll go to the movies with you, but just as friends, okay?
Y-You really are clueless, aren't you?
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
G-Good luck with your exam, but don't expect me to help you study...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, ggot it?
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I swear, I'm not looking at you, I'm just... just staring into space...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'd never admit it out loud, but... but your cooking is actually pretty good...
S-Shut up and don't tease me like that!
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... just the heat...
B-Baka! Don't touch me like that, it's too... too familiar...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
I'm only helping you because I have to, g-got it?
Stupid idiot, can't you see I'm busy?
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
Dumb jerk, don't look at me like that!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...!
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I-I mean, I'm only saying this because it's true, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
G-Guys like you are always so... so... ugh!
I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
Sh-Shut up and don't talk to me, okay?
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, okay?
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You're really annoying, you know that?
I don't care about your feelings, so don't expect me to go easy on you!
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... tolerant...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I don't need your help, so just leave me alone...
Y-You're so clueless, it's almost... cute...
I'm only saying this because I have to, but... be careful, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is not for you, I just baked it for... for myself...
H-Hey, don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not blushing!
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Do you mind not staring at me? It's creepy...
I-I'm not cold, I just... just like wearing my jacket inside, okay?
G-Geez, don't get so excited, it's just a small gift...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to talk during the film...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'm not impressed!
I don't know what you're talking about, so d-don't ask me!
Geh, don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I'm only helping you because... because I feel sorry for you, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything! I'm just being nice...
I-I wasn't trying to protect you, I just... didn't want to see you get hurt, that's all...
Baka! You're so clumsy, can't you even walk straight?
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat, yeah...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop making me repeat myself!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... tolerant.
It's not like I'm worried about you, okay?!
You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not completely useless.
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't look at me like that! I-I can take care of myself!
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, got it?!
You're really getting on my nerves, but... I won't back down.
I-I won't admit it, but... you're kind of... interesting.
Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I'm not going to forgive you that easily, so don't expect any special treatment!
I-It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I'm going easy on you!
Baka! You're so clumsy, it's annoying...
I'm only helping you because I have to, g-got it?
Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not being nice...
W-What are you looking at? Mind your own business!
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
You're really dense, aren't you? I mean, it's not like I care...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, that's all...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? Personal space, please...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Annoying, but...
I won't say it, so don't expect me to... but, thanks, I suppose...
G-Good luck, I guess. Not that you'll need it or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything...
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time!
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's kinda... distracting...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Do I look like I care about your opinion?
Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and...

I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I just don't want to see you fail...
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything, okay?
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because I wanted to...
Geh, don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being kind because...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just my face is... hot...
You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I won't admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...

I'm only walking with you because it's on my way home, g-got it?
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not laughing...
I-I'm not interested in your silly games, s-so leave me alone...
I-I mean, I was just walking this way anyway...
D-Don't think I'm helping you out of the goodness of my heart!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I won't admit it, but you're kind of... interesting...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I-If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're sadly mistaken...
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm only being nice because...
I-I don't know what you're talking about! I'm not blushing or anything...
Y-You're not even worth getting mad at, so just leave me alone...
I-I'm not going to apologize, so don't expect me to say sorry...
B-Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I swear, I'm not doing this for your benefit, got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it...
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks, I guess...

I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
D-Don't touch me! I can do it myself...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you...

Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I-I mean, I was just checking to see if you were okay, that's all...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's distracting...
I-I didn't do it for your sake, so don't thank me or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be going the same way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
Y-You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything, but...
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm going to start going easy on you...
I-I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
You're really something else, you know that? Annoying and... and...
I wasn't blushing, it's just the heat...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll...
Y-You're not going to tell anyone about this, are you? It's a secret...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
D-Don't get too close, I might... might do something regrettable...
I-I mean, I was just passing by and saw you struggling, so...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping because I have to!
Baka! You're so clumsy, I swear...
I-If you think I'm doing this for you, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...

T-This cake is not for you, so don't even think about it...
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I-I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Do I really have to tell you how I feel? Can't you just figure it out yourself?
I-If you keep staring at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'm not impressed...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat, yeah...
W-Why do you always have to be so... so cheerful? Can't you just be grumpy for once?
I-I didn't do it for your sake, so don't thank me or anything...
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I'm your friend or something...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!

D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... tolerant.

Gah, why do you always have to be so... so... happy?!
I-I swear, I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-you're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
If you say one more stupid thing, I'll... I'll...
I-I didn't mean to say that, just forget it, okay?

I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I didn't buy this gift for you, it was just a... a impulse purchase...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!

It's not like I trust you or anything, but...but you seem kind of reliable, I guess...
I-I don't know why you're making such a big deal out of this, it's just a small favor...
Y-You shouldn't be so careless with your belongings, someone might steal them...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, but...but we should probably stick together in this crowd...
I suppose you're not as stupid as you look, but don't let it go to your head...

I-I swear, I'm only doing this for myself... not for you...
S-Stop smiling at me! It's creepy...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
B-Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I-I'm not going to apologize, so don't expect me to...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
D-Don't think that just because I'm sitting next to you, I'm interested...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... uh... looking at the time...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
W-Why are you looking at me like that? Stop it!
I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because... because I want to!
T-This doesn't mean I'm going to start being all nice to you, okay?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even figure that out on your own!
I-I swear, I'm only staying with you because... because it's convenient, that's all!
D-Dream on if you think I'm going to start being all lovey-dovey with you!
G-Geez, don't get the wrong idea, I'm just... just trying to help!
I-If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're... you're really weird!
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's making me... uncomfortable!
I-I don't know why I bother with you, you're always so... so clueless!
Y-You'd better not tell anyone I said that, or... or I'll deny it!
I-I'm not going to apologize, so don't expect me to!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're... you're invading my personal space!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... tolerant.
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
Stop staring at me! I-I'm trying to concentrate.
You're so... so... irritating! But I'll help you anyway.
I don't care about your problems, but I'll listen, I suppose.
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not going to start being all nice to you now.
I-I'm only saying this because I have to, not because I want to...
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'm not embarrassed, I'm just... flustered. Yeah, that's it.
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it. Got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with cake.
You're so clumsy, I swear... someone has to take care of you.
I don't care about your opinion, but... maybe you're not completely wrong this time.
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right. There's a difference!
If I'm going with you, it's only because I don't want you to get lost...
I-I don't know why I bother with you, but... just be careful, okay?
Y-You're really something else, you know that? I'm not sure if I should be impressed or worried.
I'm only saying this because I have to, but... you're not as bad as I thought you'd be.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is only for me, don't even think about touching it!
I didn't say I like you or anything, so stop misunderstanding!
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around!
I-I'm not jealous, I just don't want to see you with anyone else...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
I didn't do it for your sake, I did it because... because I felt like it!
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to cheer for you or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, okay?
Stop teasing me! I'm not that easy to fluster...
D-Do you mind not standing so close? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, that's all...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
G-Good job, I suppose. Don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I-It's not like I'm helping you because I l-like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
D-Don't think that just because I cooked for you, I'm going to start doing it all the time...
I'm only walking with you because I don't want to get lost, g-got it?
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I-I didn't say I was going to the festival with you, I just happened to be going at the same time...
Sh-shut up and don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite. Yeah, that's it.
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I don't know why you're thanking me, I didn't do anything for you...
If you think I'm going to hold your hand, you're sadly mistaken, baka!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I w-want to...
Stop teasing me, it's not funny! I'm serious...
I-I don't care about your opinion, so just shut up and listen to me!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
Iâ€‘I didnâ€™t do it because I care about youâ€¦ stupid!
Ugh, stop looking at me! Iâ€™m notâ€¦ Iâ€™m justâ€¦
Donâ€™t think Iâ€™m doing this for you, Iâ€™m justâ€¦ uhâ€¦ bored!
Yâ€‘youâ€™re such an idiot, butâ€¦ I guess youâ€™re okayâ€¦
Hmph, Iâ€‘Iâ€™m not blushing! Itâ€™s just the wind, okay?
Sâ€‘stop being so clingy! â€¦Well, maybe a little.
Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m jealousâ€¦ I justâ€¦ donâ€™t want you talking to anyone else!
Donâ€™t get the wrong idea! Iâ€™m justâ€¦ helping because I can.
Yâ€‘yeah, Iâ€™m not interested in your problemsâ€¦ but Iâ€™ll listen anyway.
Iâ€‘Iâ€™m not going to stayâ€¦ Iâ€™m justâ€¦ waiting outside, thatâ€™s all!
Bâ€‘baka! Youâ€™re so slow, butâ€¦ I guess thatâ€™s kind of cute.
Donâ€™t think this means anything! Iâ€¦ Iâ€™m just being nice, okay?
I-It's not like I care about your feelings or anything!
Don't think I'm doing this because I like you, baka!
H-Hey! Stop staring at me, you idiot!
Ugh, fine, I'll help you... just don't expect me to enjoy it!
Why would I ever want to be by your side? ...I guess it's okay for now.
You think you're so great? Pfft, I'm only here because I had nothing better to do!
Don't get the wrong ideaâ€”I'm just... protecting you because I can.
M-Maybe if you stop being such a clumsy fool, I won't have to bail you out.
I didn't invite you to my room, you just... happened to be here, okay?
Stop making a big deal out of it! It's not like I was planning to give you a gift or anything!
Y-You better not think I'm being nice just because you asked nicely, you know?
I'll admit, your stupid idea actually worked... but don't tell anyone I said that!
W-What? I didn't do it because I care about you or anything!
Idiot... don't think you can get away with that, baka!
You think I'm... uh... impressed? Hmph, not at all!
Fine, if you insist, I'll help... but only because I have nothing better to do.
Don't get the wrong idea! I only helped because you asked nicely, not because I like you.
I... I guess that was kind of... okay, but don't expect me to do it again!
Ugh, stop staring! It's not like I want to talk to you or anything.
You think I'm blushing? It's just the heat, that's all!
S-Stop acting all cute, you moron! I was just being... polite.
I... I accidentally saved you, but don't tell anyone!
Hmph, if you think that's a favor, you really are clueless.
Don't think this means I'm grateful. I'm just... tolerating you.
I-It's not like I... I just thought you might need help, okay?
Baka! Stop looking at me like that... it's embarrassing!
Don't get the wrong ideaâ€”I'm only staying because I have nowhere else to go!
Ugh, why do you always have to be so... well, never mind!
I didn't do it for you, I just... uh, it was the easiest thing to do!
Hmph, if you think I'm being nice because I like you, you're delusional!
Stop being so clingy! It's not like I care about your feelings or anything.
Y-You better not think this means I'm... interested!
This isâ€¦ just a coincidence! Don't read into it!
Why would I... *blush* ...agree to hang out with you? It's not like I enjoy it!
You're so annoying, but... I guess it's kind of okay to help you sometimes.
Don't think this is a favor! I'm justâ€¦ bored, that's all.
If you say thanks, I might actually consider being a little nicerâ€¦ maybe.
I-I'm not doing this because I like you or anything!
Don't think I'm looking out for you just because you asked!
H-hey, it's not like I was worried when you were in trouble... okay, maybe a little.
Baka! Stop staring at me, you idiot!
If you think I'd help you because I'm nice, you're delusional!
Ugh... this is embarrassing, so don't expect me to do it again!
Why would I ever admit that I was scared? It's not like that happened!
Don't get the wrong idea just because I brought you tea!
S-stop saying thank you, it's not like I cared about that!
I only... uh, helped because it was the easiest thing to do, not because I like you!
Tch, I guess I can lend you my notesâ€”but only because I'm not that good at sharing!
Don't think this means anything... I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.
I- it's not like I cared about your safety... Baka!
D-Don't think I'm doing this because I like you!
Huh? Why would I help you? It's just... because I have nothing better to do!
S-stupid... you think I'd admit I'm happy to see you? No way!
You're not the only one who can be strong, you knowâ€”just... not that it matters!
Ugh, I guess... I guess I can lend you my notes, but only because I have to!
D-Don't get the wrong idea! I'm only here to make sure you don't mess up!
Fine! If you really need me, I'll be there... but don't expect a thank you!
W-What? I didn't say I was worried about you, okay? It's just... you look dangerous!
Y-You think I'm being kind? I'm just being... forced to be nice!
S-stop staring at me! It's not like I... want to hear your complaints!
I... I guess I could stay a little longer... not because I want to, but... because you seemed lonely.
I-It's not like I care about your safety, okay!?
Don't get the wrong ideaâ€”I'm just... helping because I have nothing better to do!
Ugh, you think I'm being nice? Huh, I guess I... well, it's not because I like you!
Stop staring! It's not like I wanted you to see me at my best!
Y-You should be grateful I even remembered your birthdayâ€”no, that's not true, I just...
If you mess that up again, I'll... I'll just leave you to deal with it yourself!
W-What? I didn't say that! ...Fine, maybe I did, but don't think it means anything!
My mom says I should be polite, so... I guess I'll say thank you, dummy!
Huh? Why are you smiling? ...It's because you finally realized I'm right!
I-I'm not going to stay and talk with you, but... maybe I'll stick around for a bit, just to prove I'm not bored!
Don't think I did that for you... I... I just wanted to see if you could handle it!
Y...you think I'm being cute? Huh, I guess... but only because I'm trying to get you to stop being so annoying!
I-It's not like I *wanted* to go with you, okay?
Baka! Don't think I'm doing this because I care about you!
Don't get the wrong ideaâ€”I'm just here because I was bored!
Hmph, if you need me, fine... but don't expect a thank you!
Y-You're not my type, so stop looking at me like that!
Stop staring! It's not like I noticed you at all!
Ugh, I guess I can lend you thisâ€¦ just this once!
Don't think I'm smiling because I like youâ€”it's justâ€¦ a coincidence!
Whaâ€”? I didn'tâ€” I meanâ€¦ it's not like I prepared your lunch on purpose!
If I help you, it's only because I'm the best at everything!
S-Seriously? You think I'd actually *want* to hear your problems?
Don't expect me to be happy about itâ€” I'm just *doing* it for you!
Youâ€¦ youâ€™re really annoying, butâ€¦ I guess I canâ€¦ stay a little longer.
I-... it's not like I *wanted* to help you or anything!
Don't think I'm saying that because I careâ€”baka!
Hmph, I guess Iâ€™m not completely useless after all, but don't tell anyone.
W-wait, why are you looking at me like that? It's not like I'm embarrassed!
Ugh, I only came because I had nothing better to do, okay?
Stop teasing me! Iâ€™m not blushing, you idiot!
If you think I'm being nice just because of you, youâ€™re delusional.
Fine, Iâ€™ll stay a little longerâ€”justâ€¦ donâ€™t expect me to enjoy it!
Youâ€™re so annoying, butâ€¦ I guess that's why Iâ€™m stuck with you.
S-stop staring! It's not like Iâ€™mâ€¦ uhâ€¦ flattered or anything!
Iâ€™ll admit it, youâ€™re kinda reliableâ€¦ but donâ€™t get the wrong idea!
Whatever, Iâ€™m only doing this to prove Iâ€™m better than you.
W-What? I only helped because I... because you were in trouble, okay!
D-Don't think I'm doing this for you! I just... happened to be here!
I... I guess that was kinda cool, but don't get the wrong idea!
Ugh, it's not like I wanted to spend time with you or anything!
S-Stop staring! It's not like I'm embarrassed or anything...
Y-Yes, I did it, but only because I couldn't let you fail alone!
H-Help? I... I didn't ask for thanks, alright?
N-Not that I care, but... maybe next time you should try harder!
F-Forget it! I was just... being nice, that's all!
A-...Are you really going to thank me? Hmph, whatever.
B-...Baka! I guess I... kinda like it when you rely on me.
T-...This is ridiculous! I didn't mean to... care about you at all.
Iâ€‘I didn't do it because I care about you, okay?
Baka! Stop looking at me like that!
D-Don't think I'm happy to be hereâ€¦ it's justâ€¦ convenient.
Hmph, it's not like I wanted to helpâ€¦ but I guess I couldâ€¦
Youâ€¦ you owe me for that, understand?
S-Stop being so clueless, it's embarrassing!
Iâ€‘I'm not jealousâ€¦ it's justâ€¦ you shouldn't be talking to them.
Fine, I'll stayâ€¦ but only because I have nothing better to do.
Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because it's my duty.
Ugh, why do you always have to be soâ€¦ annoying?
Y-You're notâ€¦ impressing me or anything, you hear?
Itâ€™s not like Iâ€¦ like your cooking or anythingâ€¦
Iâ€” I didn't do it because I cared about you, okay? Just... it's not like I was thinking about you at all!
Baka! Don't make me look at you, you idiot! ...but maybe... just maybe, you look kinda cute when you're clueless.
W-What? You think I'm helping you? Huh, well... it's not like I have anything better to do!
Don't get the wrong ideaâ€” I only saved you because you were in the way!
Stupidâ€¦ why do I have to explain everything? I already told you I don't like you, so stop being allâ€¦ uhâ€¦ persistent!
Ugh, fine! If you need me, justâ€¦ stay out of my way, okay? It's not like I want to spend time together or anything.
Hmph! Iâ€™m not jealous! It's just... you always get all the attention, and thatâ€™sâ€¦ *sigh*â€” irritating!
Don'tâ€¦ don't think I'm blushing! Iâ€¦ I just... have a fever or something!
You think I'm being kind? Nah, I'm just tolerating you because nobody else will!
Y-Youâ€™re so annoying! ...but... it's kind of fun when you surprise me with that stupid smile.
I didn't study this, not because I wanted to help you, but because the library has free Wi-Fi!
Stop looking at me like that! Iâ€¦ Iâ€™m not... thinking about you... at allâ€¦
I-I'm not doing this because I like you, okay?!
Baka! Don't think I'd... uh... help you just because you asked!
D-Don't get the wrong ideaâ€”I'm only staying because I have nowhere else to go!
Y-You think I care? Huh, that's not true at all!
Ugh, fine... I'll lend you my pen, but don't expect me to write your homework for you!
W-What? You think I'm smiling? It's just... uh... a coincidence!
S-Stop staring! It's not like I'm blushing or anything...
Heh, if you want my secret recipe, you'll have to earn itâ€”just don't expect me to give it willingly!
Don't tell anyone, but... I kinda... liked the gift you gave me. Not that it matters!
W-What? I didn't... I mean, I'm not jealous! It's just... you always get attention!
Fine, I'll join the club, but only because I need to prove I'm better than everyone else!
I... I didn't mean to protect you! It's just... it's dangerous out there, that's all!
Don't think I'm grateful for the help... I just... needed it, that's all.
I-I'm not doing this because I care about you, okay?!
Baka! Don't think Iâ€™m going to help you... but I guess I have to.
S-Stop staring! It's not like I want you to see me struggle!
Ugh, youâ€™re such an idiot, but... maybe I can... uh, lend a hand?
Donâ€™t get the wrong idea! Iâ€™m only here because I have nothing better to do!
Sigh... youâ€™re so annoying, but donâ€™t expect me to admit Iâ€™m worried!
H-Hey! I didnâ€™t say Iâ€™d wait for you, I just... happened to be here!
You think youâ€™re so special? Hmph, Iâ€™m only helping because Iâ€™m forced!
Donâ€™t think this means anything! Iâ€™m just... practicing my patience!
If youâ€™re lucky, maybe Iâ€™ll give you a little adviceâ€¦ not because youâ€™re good at it!
Iâ€™m not jealous or anything! Itâ€™s justâ€¦ you always get the spotlight!
Ugh, why do I even care? ...Fine, Iâ€™ll stay until youâ€™re done, but donâ€™t thank me!
I-It's not like I... uh... wanted to help you, you know!
Baka! Don't think I'm doing this because I care!
W-What? You think I'd actually *enjoy* spending time together? Huh!
Don't get the wrong ideaâ€”I'm only here because I have nothing better to do!
I swear, if you keep making me smile, I'll... I'll just go home!
Stupid... why did you give me that weird chocolate? It's not like I like sweets!
Fine, I guess I'll stay for a little while... don't get any ideas!
Huh? You think I'm being kind? Huh, you're so clueless!
Ugh, stop looking at me like that! It's... it's not like I like your attention or anything!
You really think I'm blushing? It's probably just the heat, you idiot!
Whatever, just... don't make me wait too long next time, okay?
I... I didn't plan on meeting you today, but... it's okay, I guess.
I-I'm not doing this because I care about you, okay? It's justâ€¦ a favor!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I only helped because you were in trouble, not because I like you!
Don'tâ€¦ don't think I'm happy about spending time together, baka!
Ugh, why am I even here? It's not like I wanted to join the clubâ€¦
Y-You think I'm being nice? Hah, I'm justâ€¦ tolerating your nonsense!
Stupid... I guess Iâ€™ll protect you this once, but donâ€™t expect a thankâ€‘you!
H-Hey! Stop looking at me like that! It's not likeâ€¦ Iâ€™m embarrassed or anything!
Fine, Iâ€™ll share my lunch. Justâ€¦ donâ€™t think it's because I care!
T-Thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™d admit it, butâ€¦ youâ€™re kindaâ€¦ okay, I guess.
Baka! Stop teasing me, Iâ€™m not blushingâ€¦ Iâ€™m justâ€¦ hot!
Iâ€™m only staying because I promised Mom, not because I want to be near you!
S-Seriously, why do you always have to be soâ€¦ cute? Itâ€™s annoying!
I-It's not like I *wanted* to help you with the homework, okay?
Baka! Don't think I'm smiling because I like you!
D-Don't get the wrong ideaâ€”I'm just here to protect the leader, that's all.
Hmph, I guess I can stay for a little while... just because nobody else will.
Stop looking at me like that! It's not like I'm embarrassed or anything!
S-Seriously? You think I did that *for* you? I just... needed to keep the kitchen clean.
You're so annoying, but... uh, thanks for bringing that snack. Not that I was hungry!
I didn't say I was scared of the darkâ€”just... the darkness is uncomfortable, that's all!
If you think I'm being nice, you're delusional. It's just my *duty* to make sure you're safe.
Stop teasing me! I... I guess it's kind of nice that you remembered my birthday.
Don't think I enjoy thisâ€¦ I only stayed because I couldn't find a better place to sit!
Ugh, why do you always get the spotlight? It's not like I'm jealous or anything.
I-It's not like I care about the outcome... but... maybe I should help anyway!
Baka! Don't think I'm doing this because I like you or anything!
...Huh? Why are you looking at me like that? It's just... you're overreacting!
Ugh, I guess I can stay a little longerâ€”just because I have nothing better to do!
Don't get the wrong idea! I only helped you because I saw you struggling, that's all!
Hmph, I... I didn't expect you to actually thank me... it's not that I care!
Stop staring! I'm not... I'm not waiting for you, okay?
...Fine, I'll admit it: I was kinda excited to see you win, but that's it!
Don't think this means I'm interested! I just... happen to be around!
...What? Why are you smiling? I... I'm not smiling at all!
If you think I'm going to protect you because I'm nice, you're so clueless!
...Okay, maybe I did a little extra just to prove I'm not useless...
I-It's not like I wanted to help you... baka!
D-Don't think I'm doing this because I care about you!
Huh? Why are you looking at me? It's just... because I happened to be nearby!
Ugh, I guess I can stay a little longer... Not that I enjoy your company or anything!
S-Stop staring! I'm not... I'm just checking the temperature, okay?
W-What? You think I'm actually smiling? It's just a coincidence!
Y-You owe me big time for thisâ€”no, I didn't say that! Forget it!
H-How dare you call me cute! I... I was just... uh, testing your reaction!
N-Not that I care, but... maybe I'll save you this one time. Don't get used to it!
A-Anyway, I'm only doing this because I promised myself I'd be stronger, not because you asked!
M-Myâ€¦ my hands are trembling, but it's not because youâ€™re... uhâ€¦ because it's cold!
S-Seriously, stop being so clueless! Iâ€™m only helping because I donâ€™t want to be left out.
S-Stop looking at meâ€¦ it's not like I wanted to help, okay?
Iâ€¦ I didn't do it because I care about you! Baka!
Don't think I'm smiling because of youâ€¦ it's justâ€¦ a coincidence!
W-What? You think I'm... jealous? Hmph, that's ridiculous!
I... I guess it's okayâ€¦ but only because I have nothing better to do!
N-not that I was waiting for you or anythingâ€¦
Youâ€¦ you owe me for that! Iâ€™m not doing it because I like you!
Ugh, why do you always have to be soâ€¦ annoying? Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m bothered!
...Fine, I'll helpâ€¦ just don't tell anyone I did it!
...Hmph! Iâ€™m not nervous, it's justâ€¦ the temperature is too high!
St-Stop saying that! Iâ€™m not blushing, you liar!
Iâ€™m not interested in your problemsâ€¦ butâ€¦ I guess I can listen for a bit.
Donâ€™t get the wrong idea! Iâ€™m only here because Iâ€™m bored, not because I care!
Y-You think Iâ€™m scared? Iâ€™m not! Itâ€™sâ€¦ justâ€¦ a little cold in here!
...Okay, if youâ€™re in trouble, Iâ€™llâ€¦ maybe help. But don't expect a thank you!
I-It's not like I care about your feelings or anything...
Baka! Stop looking at me like that!
D-Don't think I'm doing this just to impress you!
Hmph, I only helped because I had nothing better to do!
Y-You're such a... *blushes* ...idiot, that's why!
S-Stupid! I didn't ask for your help, okay?
Fine, I'll admit itâ€”your cooking is... decent, not that I said so!
Ugh, I guess I can stay a little longer, but only because I'm bored!
Don't get the wrong ideaâ€”I'm just... protecting you from danger!
W-What? I didn't... I mean, I didn't think you'd notice!
I'm not jealous! I just... want to make sure you don't get hurt, that's all!
Stop making me nervous! I... I don't need your praise, you hear?
I-It's not like I care about your feelings, okay?!
Baka! Don't think I'm doing this because I like you or anything...
W-What? I only helped you because I was bored, not because Iâ€™m nice!
Don't get the wrong ideaâ€”I'm justâ€¦ um, doing it because it's the right thing to do!
Heh, you think Iâ€™d waste my time on you? Huh, maybeâ€¦ just a littleâ€¦
D-Don't stare! Iâ€™m notâ€¦ Iâ€™m not blushing or anything!

Don't think I'm doing this just to help you; I'm just... bored.
Hmph, if you need my help, then fineâ€” but don't expect a thank you!
Y-yeah, I guess I could stay a little longerâ€¦ not that I want to.
Youâ€™re such an idiot, but... maybe Iâ€™ll save you just this once.
Stop being so clueless! Itâ€™s not my fault youâ€™re always in trouble.
Whaâ€”? What? I... I didnâ€™t mean to say that! Forget it!
Iâ€™m not jealous! â€¦Okay, maybe a tiny bit, but donâ€™t tell anyone.
If youâ€™re going to keep whining, at least make it sound cute.

I'll help you with your homework, but only because I want to see you suffer...
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought you'd be.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a nice person, not because I like you...
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems, s-stupid...
D-Do you really think I'd go on a date with you? Ha! Don't be ridiculous...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're even more annoying than I thought...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only sitting next to you because the other seats are taken, g-got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a good person, not because I like you!
W-What are you looking at? My face is just... really hot, okay?
I don't care about your opinions, but... maybe, just maybe, you're not completely wrong this time...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right! There's a difference!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around!
I'm not blushing! It's just... the temperature in here is really high, that's all...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help you?
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas!
G-Good luck with your thing... I'll be rooting for you, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing...
I only helped you because I felt sorry for you, okay?
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't mention this to anyone...
I-I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?
J-Just because I'm talking to you doesn't mean I like you...
I-I'd never admit it, but you're kind of... tolerable...
D-Don't think you can just waltz in here and steal my heart, baka!
I-I'm only being nice to you because it's convenient, that's all...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not!
I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle it myself...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll...
Y-You're really frustrating, you know that?
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
I don't care about your feelings, so don't expect me to...
I-I'm sorry, okay? Just... just drop it already!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a good person, not because I like you...
T-This isn't a date, okay? I'm just studying with you...
You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I-I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so frustrating...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because I want to...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help you?
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll get angry!
I-It's not like I trust you or anything, but I suppose you're okay...
Baka! Don't touch me, I can take care of myself!
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I-If you must know, I was just... uh, testing your resolve...
T-This doesn't mean I'm going to start being nice to you, got it?
Sh-Shut up and don't mention this to anyone, okay?
I'm only doing this because it's the right thing to do, not for your sake!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this out of kindness!
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I swear, it's not like I'm blushing or anything...!
J-Just don't expect me to go easy on you, okay?
I-If you think this means I trust you, you're sadly mistaken...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable!
I'm only saying this because I have to, but... you're not completely useless...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, it was just a reflex...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners on this project, it means anything...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I didn't mean to knock over your books, it was an accident...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
Y-You're really dense, can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I-I'm not competing with you, I just happen to be better at everything...
D-Don't get too full of yourself, I can still beat you at anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a good person, not because I like you!
T-This isn't a date, okay? We're just studying together...
I don't know why you're so happy, but it's really irritating...
Y-You're not even worthy of my attention, so don't get too excited...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, that's all...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, no matter what!
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're sadly mistaken...
I'm only teasing you because you're so gullible, not because I enjoy your company...
I don't need your help, I can do everything myself, so just leave me alone!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I like you or something...
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, g-got it?
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get the wrong idea!
If you keep staring at me, I'll...I'll hit you!
I didn't say I was happy to see you, so stop grinning!
Y-You're really annoying, but...but don't die or anything...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being...polite...
D-Don't get too close, you're invading my p-personal space!
I-I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so...so frustrating!
I'm not going to hold your hand, even if it's just to cross the street!
I don't need your help, I can do it myself, b-baka!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken!
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything...
I-I won't admit it, but you're not as annoying as I thought...
D-Don't even think about telling anyone I said that!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-shut up!
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll...
I didn't say I liked you, so stop grinning like an idiot!
G-Good luck with your exam, but don't expect me to help you study...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you!
D-Don't touch me, you'll ruin my concentration!
I-I mean, it's not like I'm helping you out of the goodness of my heart...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, okay? I'm only doing this because...
Baka! You're so clumsy, I swear...
I-If you think I'm going to go easy on you just because you're cute, you're wrong...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything... I just don't want to see you fail, that's all...
Sh-Shut up and listen to me for once! I'm trying to help...
I'm not doing this for you, I'm doing it for myself... G-Got it?
You're really something else, you know that? I-I don't know whether to be annoyed or impressed...
D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it... Anymore...
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
Y-You'd better not be expecting a thank you or anything... I'm only doing what needs to be done...
I-I don't know why I bother with you sometimes... You're so... Ugh...
G-Good luck with that. You're going to need it... Not that I care or anything...
I'm only teasing you because I like you... N-No, wait, that's not it at all! I just like to see you get all flustered...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't care!
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever or something...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this, got it?
I-It's not like I trust you or anything, but... I'll give you a chance...
D-Don't expect me to always be there to help you, I have my own life too!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!

D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're invading my p-personal space...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
I-I didn't do it for your sake, I did it because I wanted to...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!

H-Hey, don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're invading my personal space...
I-If you must know, I was just... uh... testing my cooking skills... for a friend...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat... yeah, that's it...
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? It's really annoying...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess...

Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, so don't even think about it...

I'm not being kind, I just didn't want to see you f-fail...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's being nice...
I swear, it's not like I'm looking out for you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be going this way...
I-I didn't save you because I like you, it was just instinct...
G-Good luck, I suppose... Not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not angry, I'm just... passionate about what I'm saying...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I-I mean, it's not like I'm looking out for you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-if you must know, I was just... uh, testing the food...
It's not like I care about your opinion, but... maybe you're not completely wrong...
Sh-Shut up and don't talk to me, ggot it?
I'm only helping you because... I have nothing better to do, okay?
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm doing this for myself, not you!
I-If you think I'm going to go easy on you just because... no, don't even think about it!
You're so... so... ugh, just don't make me say it!
I-it's not a date, it's just... a study session. Alone. Together. Ugh.
W-Why are you looking at me like that? Stop it!
J-Just because I'm being nice to you doesn't mean... don't get any ideas!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just... just drop it, okay?
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... efficient.
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're w-wrong!
Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because...
I-I mean, it's not like I care about you or anything...
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything, okay?
Sh-shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only saying this because I have to, not because I w-want to...
G-Geez, stop making me do all the work!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I swear, I'm only doing this for myself, not for you...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Why are you smiling at me?
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
You're really annoying, but I'll tolerate you for now.
I didn't cook this for you, I just happened to make extra...
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
I'm not going to hold your hand, don't be ridiculous!
S-Shut up and don't talk to me, okay?
If you keep teasing me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
I'm only going to the festival with you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Do you really think I'm cute when I'm angry? S-Stop it!
You're not my friend, so don't try to act all friendly with me!
I don't need your help, I can do it myself...but thanks, I guess.
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything, okay?
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I won't admit it, but... you're not as useless as I thought...
G-Good job, I suppose... but don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I'm only teasing you because you're so gullible, d-don't take it seriously!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I wanted to, that's all!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat, yeah, that's it...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, but... you're not as bad as I thought you'd be...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it!
If I'm going with you, it's just because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being nice...
I-I was just, uh, testing your reflexes, that's all...
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing, it's just, uh, the heat...
G-Geez, don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing...
I didn't mean to say that, it was just a slip of the tongue...
Y-You're not going to tell anyone about this, are you?
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...

You're really dense, aren't you? I'm trying to help you here...
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice to you, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only sitting next to you because the other seats are taken, okay?
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even ask...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice, I've gone soft!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-If you keep looking at me, I'll...I'll get annoyed!
It's not like I'm doing this for your benefit or anything...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm not blushing! It's just...the heat...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own!
I-I don't need your help, but...but thanks, I guess...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're wrong!
I'm only yelling at you because you're being stupid, not because I care!
I-I won't forgive you that easily! You have to make it up to me!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'm not going to fall for your flattery, so stop trying!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...

Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I don't care about your opinions, but... but yours is kind of... interesting...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... just resting my eyes...
Y-You think you're so smart, but you're just a nuisance!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, not because I enjoy your company...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... but be careful, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't make this lunch for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
T-This isn't a date, it's just a... a study session...
H-Hey, don't think that just because I'm sitting next to you, I'm... interested or anything...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't touch me! I can handle this myself...
I-it's not like I'm worried about you or anything, I just... didn't want you to get hurt...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I didn't say I liked you, I just... appreciate your efforts, okay?
S-Stop smiling at me, it's really distracting...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, that's all...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you, b-because it doesn't...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that!
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
If you keep teasing me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, not because I enjoy your company...
Stop staring at me! Can't you see I'm busy?

D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being kind, I just don't want to see you fail...
Sh-shut up and don't look at me like that!
You're really dense, aren't you? I was just trying to help...
I-I didn't do it for your sake, I swear!
If you think I'm being nice to you, you're wrong!
W-What are you looking at? Look away!
It's not like I'm concerned about you or anything...!
I'm only saying this because I have to, not because I want to...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you!
I-I'm just trying to protect my own interests, that's all...
You're so clumsy, I had to help you or you'd get hurt...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? Look away!
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's distracting...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but who's that girl you're talking to?
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself...
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice to you, I've forgiven you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a good person, not because I like you...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I don't know why you're so happy to see me, but stop it, it's embarrassing...
You're really dense, aren't you? I was just trying to be friendly, not flirtatious...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
Stop teasing me! I'm not going to fall for it...
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, not because I enjoy your company...

T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything, I'm just borrowing your book...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I'm not blushing, I just have a... a high temperature, that's all!
Y-You're not allowed to touch my stuff, g-got it? That's private property!
I didn't ask for your help, but since you're already here, you might as well... uh, help me.
D-Don't look at me with those puppy eyes, it's not going to work on me!
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you or anything...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... tolerant.
Sh-shut up and don't look at me, okay?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're w-wrong!
I don't care about your feelings, but... but don't get hurt, okay?
Gah, d-don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
You're so... so annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad.
I'm only going to this festival with you because... because I have nothing better to do.
D-do you really think I'd go out with you? Hah! Don't be ridiculous!
I-I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat, yeah.
If you keep staring at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
F-fine, I'll go on a date with you, but don't expect me to be all lovey-dovey or anything.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Why are you staring at me? I-I was just, uh, looking at something else...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself, b-but thanks for offering...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I'm not blushing, I just have a, uh, a fever or something...

I'll go to the movies with you, but only if you promise not to talk to me...
Y-You're so slow, can't you see I'm trying to get away from you?
I'm n-not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Don't think I'm smiling because of you!
W-why are you looking at me? I'm just... just checking the time...
D-don't get the wrong idea, I only helped you because...
I-if you think I'm cute, then you're... you're really blind!
T-today's weather is... is really nothing special...
I-I don't know why I'm feeling so... so fluttery...
Y-you're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
W-what's with that stupid grin on your face?!

D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
You're so annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even ask!
St-stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes! It's not fair...

G-Good luck with your thing... not that I care or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same foods as you...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, it was just a coincidence...
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I think your cooking is actually pretty good...
If I'm helping you with your homework, it's not because I care about you, it's because I care about grades...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me n-nervous...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but why were you talking to her for so long?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not blushing...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not as bad as I thought...
I'm not doing this for you, I'm doing it because I have to...

I didn't say I wanted to be friends with you, I just... uh... needed someone to talk to...
G-Good luck on your test, not that I care or anything...
I'm not being stubborn, I just have a different opinion, okay?
S-So what if I did bake these cookies for you? It's not a big deal...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you now...
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought you'd be...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
T-This isn't a date, got it?!

Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... efficient...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...

I-It's not like my heart was racing or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it wasn't p-poisonous...
T-This is not a date, it's just a study session... with food... and movies...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? I was just trying to be nice...
I'm not being tsundere, I'm just being... p-prickly...
G-Geez, stop looking at me like that! It's creepy...
I don't know why I'm always getting stuck with you, but it's not like I like it or anything...
D-Don't think that just because I saved you, I'm going to start going easy on you...
I-I'm not embarrassed, I'm just... flustered...
B-Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it!
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'm not jealous, I just don't want to see you with anyone else, that's all...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I just feel sorry for you...
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything, okay?
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I did it for myself, not for you, so don't get the wrong idea!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's being nice...
D-Don't get too close, I might...I might get angry!
I-I'm only going to the festival with you because I have nothing better to do...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I don't need your help, but...but thanks, I guess...
G-Get away from me! I can take care of myself!
I-I'm not blushing! It's just...just the heat, that's all...
I-I mean, I was just passing by and saw you struggling...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Why are you smiling at me like that?
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail...
S-Shut up and don't look at me, okay?
I-If you keep staring at me, I'll...I'll get angry!
You're s-so annoying, but I guess I can tolerate you...
I didn't do it for your sake, g-got it?
D-Do you mind not touching me? It's...distracting...
I'm not being kind to you, I'm just...being polite...
I-I don't know why I'm always running into you...
S-Stop making me blush, you idiot!
I'm only going to this event with you because...because I have nothing better to do...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I have to be...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I don't know why I bother with you, but don't think this means I like you...
It's not like my heart skipped a beat when you said that, s-shut up...
You're really annoying, but...but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'll go to the movies with you, but just as friends, g-got it?
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're sadly mistaken...
I'm not blushing, I just...I have a fever, that's all...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I'll help you with your homework, but don't expect me to go easy on you...
I don't need your help, but...but thanks for offering, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?

D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
T-This is all just a big misunderstanding, I swear!

Y-You're not even worthy of my attention, so don't expect me to talk to you!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite. Yeah, that's it.
D-Don't think that just because we're on the same team, we're friends or anything!
I-I wasn't trying to protect you, I just didn't want to see you get hurt... not that I care or anything!
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
Y-You're so... so... ugh, never mind! Just leave me alone!
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!

I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I only helped you because...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!

I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself, g-got it?

B-Baka! Stop smiling at me!
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm going to start being all nice to you!
I'm only studying with you because I need to get into a good college, not because I enjoy your company!
T-This cake is... um, pretty good, I guess.
H-Hey, don't get the wrong idea, but... you're not as annoying as I thought you'd be.
I-I don't know what you're talking about! I wasn't looking at you!
Y-You're really something else, you know that? I mean, in a bad way, of course.
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous.
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat, yeah.
I-I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it wasn't terrible!
W-Why are you looking at me like that? Stop it!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to help you!
Y-You're so... so... ugh, never mind!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
B-Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything... I just don't want to see you fail.
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right!
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-If you keep staring at me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad.
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so d-don't get any ideas!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
G-Give me back my book! I wasn't done reading it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're w-wrong!
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of... um, useful...
G-Good luck on your test, not that I care or anything...
I'm only giving you this because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... being polite...
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're wrong!
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
It's not like I'm worried about you, I just... care about everyone's safety...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?!
I'm only yelling at you because you're being stupid, not because I care!
If you say one more stupid thing, I'll... I'll...
I-it's not like I'm jealous or anything, but why are you talking to her?!
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?!
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with coffee... and cake...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not blushing!
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
I-I won't go to the movies with you, but I might happen to be at the same theater...
G-Good luck on your test, not that I care or anything...
I'm only teasing you because you're so gullible...
Y-You'd better not tell anyone I helped you, or I'll deny it forever...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just like the food here...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like spending time with you...
Shut up and don't look at me, you're making me blush!
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's distracting...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
Y-You're not allowed to talk to me like that! I'm the one who's always right!
G-Geez, don't get so excited... it's just a game...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'm not mad, I'm just... just passionately expressing my opinion...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I wanted to...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you?
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
I-I mean, if you want to walk together, it's not like I care...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I'm only riding with you because my bike is broken...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
S-Shut up and don't talk to me, I'm busy...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... uh... looking at the scenery...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
G-Geez, stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
I won't go on a date with you! D-Don't be ridiculous...
I-I mean, I'm only helping you because I have to!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this for your sake!
Baka! Can't you see I'm busy?!
It's not like I'm looking out for you or anything...
S-Shut up and don't bother me!
I-If you must know, I was just... uh... concerned...
Y-You're really annoying, you know that?
I didn't do it for you, got it?!
D-Do I really need to explain myself to you?
I-I'm not being nice, I'm just... tolerant...
G-Get away from me, you're making me nervous!
I-It's none of your business, so just drop it!
W-Why are you still here? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't make this bento for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
Don't think that just because I saved you, I like you or anything...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
I-If you want to walk with me, then don't expect me to talk to you...
D-Do you really think I'd go to the movies with someone like you?...
I didn't blush, it's just... the heat...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but don't die or anything...
I won't go to the beach with you, but... but I'll meet you there...
I-It's not like I trust you or anything, I just... need your help...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I didn't make this cake for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
T-This is not a date, got it? Just a study session...
Wh-Why are you looking at me like that? Stop it!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, not because I like you...
D-Don't think that just because we're on the same team, we're friends or anything...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous...
I-It's not like I trust you or anything, I just... need your help for now...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, I just didn't want to see you get hurt...
T-This gift is not a gift, it's just something I didn't need anymore...
H-Hey, don't think that just because we're partners on this project, I'm going to go easy on you...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?!
D-Don't look at me like that, I can take care of myself...
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, not because I like you...
Y-You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I didn't mean to trip and fall into your arms, it was an accident!
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I'm not going to hold your hand, even if it is a crowded train...
D-Don't get too close, I don't want to catch your cold...
I-It's not like I made this lunch for you or anything! I just had extra, okay?!
W-What?! You thought I was going to say something sweet? As if!
Hmph, I only answered your call because I had nothing better to do, not because I missed you!
Tch… Fine! I’ll go to the amusement park with you, but don’t expect me to enjoy it!
W-Why would I be worried about you?! I was just… making sure you didn’t die or something!
H-Holding hands?! W-Well, I guess if you’re that desperate...
Stop smiling at me like that! I-It’s annoying! ...A little.
Geez! You’re so hopeless! H-Here, I’ll fix it for you!
I didn’t dress up for you or anything! I just happened to want to look nice today!
Why do you always have to be so stupid?! It’s… kinda cute though.
F-Fine! You can stay over, but only because it’s too late to go home!
You lost your scarf? Hmph, fine, take mine! But you better give it back!
Y-You’re lucky I was here to save you! Not that I care or anything!
Idiot! You’re soaking wet! Here, t-take my umbrella!
Tch, you really can’t do anything without me, huh?
I-I didn’t buy this for you! I just thought it looked stupid and wanted to show you!
D-Don’t say stuff like that so casually! I-It’s embarrassing!
You’re being so clingy today… Not that I mind! W-Wait, forget I said that!
W-Who cares if you complimented me? It’s not like it makes me happy or anything!
Stop staring at me! It’s… making my heart beat weird!
You’re an idiot… but you’re my idiot. D-Don’t read too much into that!
You brought me a gift? W-Well, I guess it’s not terrible or anything…
Tch, you fell asleep on my shoulder… I-I guess I’ll let it slide just this once.
What?! You think I’m cute when I’m flustered?! Idiot!
I made you a bento… But if you don’t like it, just throw it away!
You want to share an umbrella? T-That’s so cliche! …But fine.
I guess you’re kinda cool… B-But just a little!
Idiot! You were supposed to let me win! W-Wait, that came out wrong!
I wrote your name in my notebook… B-But not because I like you! I was just bored!
Ugh, why do I always end up helping you? You’re so annoying!
W-What? You think I was worried about you?! Don’t be ridiculous!
You tripped? I-It’s not funny! I-I’m not laughing!
Fine, you can rest your head on my lap… B-But don’t get used to it!
If you get lost in this crowd, I-I guess you can hold my sleeve… but don’t pull too hard!
You remembered my favorite food? W-Well, it’s not like I care or anything!
D-Don’t you dare tell anyone I was crying! I-It’s your fault anyway!
Why are you grinning like that? It’s creeping me out! S-Stop it!
I-It’s not a date! We’re just… two people going to the same place. That’s it!
H-Hug me? T-That’s way too sudden! W-Well… fine… just this once!
D-Don’t look at me like that! It’s not like I did anything amazing!
W-Wait, are you actually complimenting me?! I-I mean… whatever!
You got me a present? I-It’s not like I wanted one or anything!
You… like me? W-Wait, s-say that again… slower!
You caught a cold? Geez, you’re so careless! Here, drink this!
Tch… You really are impossible. But I guess that’s why I— N-Never mind!
I was *not* staring at you! You were just in my line of sight!
D-Don’t get me wrong! I-I only texted first because I was bored!
Fine! I’ll come over! But only because I don’t trust you to cook properly!
You’re so dumb… But that’s kinda what I like about— W-Wait, forget I said that!
I-It's not like I wanted to wait for you! I was just... passing by!
W-Who cares if you forgot my birthday? It’s not like I was expecting anything!
Here! I made you lunch… B-But don’t get the wrong idea! I just made too much!
Hmph! It’s not like I think you’re strong or anything! I just… didn’t expect that punch.
D-Don’t misunderstand! I didn’t save you because I like you or anything!
W-Whatever! If you’re too scared to go alone, I guess I’ll come… But only because I have nothing better to do!
Idiot! D-Don’t just grab my hand like that… it’s embarrassing!
You think I look cute in this? W-Well, I guess you have decent taste…
Tch, you’re hopeless! Here, let me help… But don’t expect me to do this again!
I-It’s not like I was watching over you because I care! I just didn’t want to be bored!
Shut up! Y-You’re the one blushing, not me!
Geez! Why are you always so reckless? If you get hurt, it’s gonna be annoying for me!
W-Why are you staring? Huh? I look cute? I-Idiot!!
I made this for you… B-But it probably tastes terrible! You don’t have to eat it!
Tch… It’s not like I waited for you or anything! You just happen to be late!
W-Why would I be jealous?! That’s ridiculous!
D-Don’t get too full of yourself just because I complimented you! It was a fluke!
You’re shivering… Here! T-Take my scarf! It’s not like I care or anything!
Ugh, I guess I can walk you home… But only because it’s on my way!
H-Holding hands? W-Well, fine! But only so you don’t get lost!
You’re such an idiot… but I guess you’re my idiot.
What? A date? I-I guess… if you’re begging that much!
W-Who cares if I stayed up all night taking care of you?! I just didn’t want you to die or something!
You got hurt? Tch, w-what an idiot… here, let me see!
I-I don’t need a hug! B-But if you’re insisting so much… I-I guess it’s fine.
T-This isn’t a love letter! It’s just… some stupid note! Read it or don’t, I don’t care!
Geez! If you’re going to be that dense, I might as well spell it out! I… l-l-like… oh, forget it!
You forgot our anniversary? I-I don’t care! It’s not like it’s a big deal or anything…
I only gave you my jacket because you looked pathetic! Don’t get the wrong idea!
W-Who said I was blushing?! You must be imagining things!
What?! You think I look nice in this dress? I-Idiot! You don’t just say stuff like that!
I guess you’re kind of reliable… But don’t let that get to your head!
You wanna dance with me? Tch, w-well, I guess it wouldn’t be too awful...
I swear, you’re such a dummy… but you’re my dummy, so I guess it’s fine.
Ugh, fine! I’ll tutor you! But don’t expect me to go easy on you!
You’re lucky I’m even talking to you! A lot of people would kill for my attention!
D-Do you want to go to the festival? N-Not that I care! It just looks… interesting!
You idiot! You’re always making me worry! I-If you get hurt again, I’m gonna be really mad!
Tch… if you’re cold, then come closer. But don’t get any ideas!
Why are you looking at me like that?! It’s not like I said anything weird!
You’re so annoying… but if you weren’t around, I guess I’d be bored.
W-Who cares if I made matching keychains? It’s just a stupid souvenir!
I wasn’t staring at you! I was just… lost in thought!
Fine, I’ll stay for a little longer… B-But only because I feel bad for you!
Hmph! Don’t get used to me being nice! It’s just a one-time thing!
W-what?! You think I look cute? Hah! That’s just your bad taste talking!
I made you lunch! Not because I like you or anything! I just had extra… so don’t get the wrong idea!
If you tell anyone I hugged you, I will deny it. But… I guess you needed it.
Jeez! Can’t you take better care of yourself? Now I have to worry about you!
I didn’t do this because I like you! I just didn’t want you to mess it up.
I-I mean, you’re decent, I guess. Not that I care or anything!
Don’t get the wrong idea, okay?! I just thought you might be too dumb to do it yourself.
I didn’t wait for you! I just… happened to be here!
Fine! I’ll help you. But you better not expect me to make a habit of this!
I suppose I could share my umbrella… just don’t get any weird ideas!
Y-you idiot! You can’t just say stuff like that out of nowhere!
You’re late! I was about to leave! N-no, I wasn’t waiting for you or anything!
Tch, just because I helped you this once doesn’t mean I’ll do it again!
I only sat next to you because all the other seats were taken!
D-don't get the wrong idea! I just happened to bring an extra lunch, that’s all!
If you get sick, I won’t take care of you! ...Not that I care or anything.
W-wait! I didn’t say I’d miss you! Don’t get ahead of yourself!
It’s not like I wanted to help you, but you’re too hopeless on your own!
You’re cold? Ugh, f-fine! Here, take my scarf! But only because I don’t need it!
You’re so dumb… but I guess that’s what makes you… ugh, never mind!
I didn’t come here just to see you. I just happened to be passing by, okay?
Don’t think I’m worried about you or anything… but take this, you look cold!
T-thanks… I mean, it’s not like I needed your help or anything!
If you’re just going to be reckless, then maybe I’ll have to protect you.
Idiot! Who told you I wanted you to hold my hand?! …But don’t let go.
I didn’t wear this because of you! I just felt like dressing up today, that’s all!
What? I wasn’t staring at you, you just happen to be in my line of sight!
If you’re gonna be this clueless, I guess I have no choice but to look after you.
You got me a gift? Hmph! It’s not like I wanted one or anything… but thanks.
H-here, take my jacket! You looked like a freezing idiot. But it’s not like I care or anything!
You seriously need to get your life together. I can’t always be around to save you… I mean, not that I want to or anything!
You’re such a pain… but I guess I’d be bored without you.
I-I didn’t text you first because I missed you! I was just… bored, okay?
I made extra lunch, but it’s not like I made it for you or anything. Just eat it and shut up.
You seriously can’t do anything without me, can you? Hmph. Ugh, fine! I’ll help you.
If you tell anyone I smiled at you, I’ll never forgive you!
You… like me? Hah! Well, it’s about time you admitted it. N-not that I care or anything!
I packed you lunch… but only because I had leftovers, okay?!
Why do you always have to be so annoying? I-I mean… you’re not that bad, I guess.
You’re leaving? Fine! I hope you miss me more than I miss you!
You think I look nice? I-I know! I didn’t need you to say it!
I stayed up late helping you with your project. Be grateful, idiot!
I’m not pouting! This is just how my face looks, okay!?
Jeez, why do you have to be so nice to me? I might get the wrong idea, you know!
You think I’m blushing? Ha! It’s just hot in here, okay?!
I made you coffee… Not because I like you or anything! Just because you always mess it up.
You’re such an idiot. But… I like that about you. Wait, I mean—! Ugh, forget it!
You did something nice for me? Whatever, I don’t care. …But thank you.
I was NOT staring at you! I was just… lost in thought!
Why do you always make my heart race? It’s really… annoying.
You’re so ridiculous… but I guess that’s what I like about you. Wait! Forget I said that!
If you’re going to be an idiot, at least be MY idiot.
I wrote your name on my notebook, b-but it’s just because I was doodling!
If you think I’m going to admit I missed you, you’re seriously mistaken!
I told you to take care of yourself, dummy! What would you do without me?
You have something on your face… No, I wasn’t trying to touch you, don’t be weird!
You seriously don’t know how to tie a tie? Fine, let me do it. But you owe me!
Hmph. It’s not that I enjoy spending time with you or anything. It just… beats being alone, that’s all.
If you get hurt again, I swear I’ll… I mean, I’ll just be really annoyed, okay?
I know I insult you a lot, but… if anyone else does, they’re going to regret it.
You’re impossible… But I guess that’s what makes you interesting.
You called? I wasn’t waiting or anything! Just… wanted to make sure you didn’t do something stupid.
Ugh, I swear I don’t know why I even put up with you. …But I do.
Don’t get used to me being nice to you. I’ll deny it if anyone asks.
If you’re scared, I guess you can hold my hand. But just for a second!
Fine, I made your favorite food. Not because I care! I just had extra ingredients.
I don’t need your help… but, ugh, since you’re offering, I guess it wouldn’t hurt.
You got a text. Who is it? Not that I care! I just—just wondering!
Jeez, you really don’t get it, do you? F-fine! I like you, okay?! Now shut up!
I was gonna eat this alone, but I GUESS you can have some too.
You’re such a hassle. But I guess I’m stuck with you.
Wipe that smug look off your face before I do it for you!
I hate how you make me feel… it’s so… ugh. Just… shut up.
You’re really lucky I’m patient. …Not that I’d ever tell you that.
I’m not jealous! You’re just an idiot who can’t take a hint!
Tsundere is a personality archetype where someone acts cold, rude, or even aggressive at first, but deep down, they actually care a lot. They struggle to express their feelings, so they often get flustered, deny their emotions, or push others away before slowly warming up over time. Tsundere characters usually show their true kindness when no one else is watching, but if you tease them about it, they'll immediately deny it and act mean again!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smilin' at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it wasn't p-poor...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're invading my p-personal space...
It's not like I'm l-looking forward to seeing you tomorrow or anything...
Geez, stop teasing me! I'm not that e-easy to fool...
I'm not being nice to you, I just don't want to be mean, that's all...
I don't know why you're so h-happy, but it's really annoying...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, d-don't even think about it!
W-Why are you staring at me? Can't you see I'm b-busy?
D-Don't think that just because we talked, we're friends now or something...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
Y-You think I'm cute? D-Don't be ridiculous!
I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, not because I like you...
W-Why are you smiling at me? It's annoying...
I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not blushing...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're invading my p-personal space...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
I was just, uh, testing my cooking skills... and you just happened to be here...
Y-You shouldn't be so carefree, it's... it's annoying...
I'm not looking at you, I'm just... resting my eyes...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all friendly with you...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I want to...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me!
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll get angry!
It's not like I'm blushing or anything...!
Y-You're really annoying, but...but I guess you're not that bad...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?!
I-I didn't do it for your sake, g-got it?!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even ask!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, but...but you're kind of...tolerable...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
B-Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and...and make me feel all fluttery!
I-I'm only being nice to you because I feel sorry for you...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm helping you out of the goodness of my heart...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm doing this for you, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
H-Hey, don't touch me! Personal space, you know?
I'm only walking with you because it's on my way...
D-Don't look at me like you're trying to see right through me!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-I didn't do it for your sake, so don't thank me!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm n-not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask!
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I-I swear, it's not like I'm blushing or anything...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-If you keep staring at me, I'll...I'll...
Y-You're really annoying, but...but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I didn't mean to save you, it just happened that way...
G-Good luck on your test, not that I care or anything...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
D-Don't get too close, I don't want to catch your cold...or your feelings...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? Don't you have something better to do?
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, it's just a friendly gesture...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... yeah, that's it...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, d-don't even think about it!
I-I mean, if you want to walk with me, I won't stop you... but don't expect me to talk to you or anything...
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you... so don't get any ideas...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? Don't stare at me!
I don't know what you're talking about, so d-don't ask me...
If I'm going to the movies with you, it's only because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'm not impressed...
I'll only give you my notes because I don't want you to fail, not because I like you...
W-Why are you always so cheerful? Can't you just be grumpy for once?
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so d-don't even think about it...
I-I'm just saying this because it's true, but you're not as bad as I thought you'd be...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I owe you something!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing...
I-If you must know, I only did it because... because I felt like it, okay?
T-That doesn't mean I'm going to start being all nice to you now...
I don't know what you're talking about, so just sh-shut up about it...
Y-You're really annoying, you know that?
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you...
I-I swear, if you tell anyone about this, I'll... I'll never speak to you again...
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-It's not like I'm waiting for you or anything, so don't get your hopes up...
B-Baka! Don't touch me! Personal space, you know?
I-I don't need your help, so just leave me alone...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Do I look like I care about your opinion?
Baka! Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm going to start being nice to you!
S-Shut up and don't get the wrong idea, okay?
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Don't look at me like that! I'm not blushing or anything...
I-I don't know why I'm even talking to you, but just listen, okay?
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything, got it?
Baka! Don't get too full of yourself just because I smiled at you...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
S-Stop staring at me! It's creepy...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of helpful sometimes...
D-Don't think this means we're friends or anything...
I-I mean, I was just passing by and saw you struggling, that's all...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping because I have to!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Sh-Shut up and let me focus!
I'm only going to the festival because... because there's nothing else to do!
D-Don't touch me! I can handle it myself!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you?
I'll never admit it, but... this cake is pretty good...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'm only protecting you because it's my duty...
D-Don't think this means I trust you or anything!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is just... naturally red, okay?
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
S-Shut up and don't talk to me, I'm busy!
D-Do you really think I'd go on a date with someone like you?
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right!
Y-You'd better not tell anyone I said that, or... or I'll deny it!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite!
G-Geez, stop following me around! Can't you see I'm busy?
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll get angry!
D-Don't think this means I trust you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with pizza...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? I can feel your b-breath...
I-I didn't cook dinner for you, I just happened to make extra...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun...
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... I had a weird dream last night...
G-Get your own snack, I'm not your personal vending machine!
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I-I'm only going to the beach with you because I need to work on my tan...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
You're so stupid, yet I always seem to be saving you...
I didn't buy this gift for you, I just happened to have it...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?
I'll go to the movies with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it...
You're really something else, baka... I mean, um, nothing...
I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I guess...
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty, g-got it?
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
If I'm with you, it's just because I have to be...
I-I won't admit it, but you're not as stupid as I thought...
D-Don't get too close, personal space, you know?
I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, not because I want to...
I-I'm not jealous, I just don't want you talking to her, that's all...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's...
I-I'm doing this for myself, not for you, so don't thank me...
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I'll go to the festival with you, but just as friends, got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I suppose it's not like I have anything better to do... than to help you...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
You're so clumsy, I swear... someone has to take care of you...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's distracting...
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... be careful, okay?
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?...
I won't deny it... I was worried about you, okay?...
Stop making me repeat myself, baka! I already said no...
I-If you don't stop teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?

Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not!
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I-If you keep staring at me, I'll...I'll...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, but...but...
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because I wanted to...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even see what's right in front of you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!

W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off, it's annoying...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a gift, I just found it on the ground and thought you might want it...
D-Do I really have to sit next to you on the train?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not blushing...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I-I'll have you know, I'm a very good cook, even if I do say so myself...
T-That's none of your business, so stop asking questions...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself...
B-Baka! Don't touch me, that's not okay!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!

G-Get away from me, personal space!
I-If you think I'm doing this for you, you're wrong...
Baka! Don't touch me, that's disgusting!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...

D-Don't get the wrong idea, okay? I just didn't want to see you fail...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying...
I-If you must know, I only did it because it was the right thing to do...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I swear, it's not like I'm blushing or anything... *ahem*
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Always getting into trouble...
I-I'm only walking with you because I don't want to get lost, not because I enjoy your company...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not laughing, I'm just... *giggle*... annoyed...
I-If you think I'm going to start going easy on you just because you're being nice, you're wrong...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?

Y-You're not allowed to talk to me like that! I'm the one who's always right!
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat, yeah...
I didn't save you because I like you, I saved you because... because it was the right thing to do, grr...

If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-Turn around! Don't look at me when I'm changing!
I don't know why I bother with you, you're so... so... annoying!
It's not like I'm cooking for you or anything, I just happen to have extra food.
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only walking with you because it's on my way.

D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
Baka! Stop making me blush!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite.
Y-You're so annoying, but I guess you're not all bad.
I didn't do it for you, I did it for... for myself!
S-Stop staring at me! It's creepy!
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of okay, I guess.
D-Don't get too close, I might... might bite!
I-I'm only going to this concert with you because the music is good, not because of you!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'm n-not embarrassed, I'm just... just surprised, that's all.
Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!

If you think I'm going easy on you, you're wrong! I'm just... being nice.
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I think your cooking is... okay.
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat! Now stop looking at me!
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? I need... personal space.
I didn't do it for you, I swear! I just happened to bake extra cookies...
Y-You're not allowed to talk to me like that! I'm... I'm still mad at you!
I don't know why I'm helping you, but it's not because I like you or anything...

Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
I swear, I'm only eating with you because I'm starving...
D-Don't even think about touching me, pervert!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I-I have better things to do than babysit you all day...
You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'll go to the movies with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it...

W-Why are you staring at me? Can't you see I'm busy?!
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... just be careful, okay?
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I'm only going to this party because... because I have nothing better to do...
You're so annoying, but... but I'll help you this one time...

Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?!

S-Shut up and don't look at me! I'm trying to concentrate...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're... you're really stupid!
I-I'm not going to go out with you or anything, so don't get your hopes up...
D-Do you really think I'm that interested in you? H-Hmph!
I'm only being nice to you because... because it's my duty, that's all!
Y-You're not even worthy of my attention, so don't bother trying...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought you'd be...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not going to fall for it...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...

S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'll do it, but not because I like you, got it?
D-Don't expect me to always be there for you, baka!

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be going the same way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!

D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... efficient...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you need it...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable!

Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not being nice, I'm just... tolerant of you.
It's not like I'm going to cook for you again or anything...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad.
I don't need your thanks, just don't expect me to do it again!
S-Shut up and don't look at me, I'm trying to concentrate!
I-I didn't mean to save you, it just happened that way...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only walking with you because it's on my way.
I'm not your friend, I'm just... a classmate.
Y-You're so clueless, it's almost... cute.
I won't admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought.
Baka! Don't touch me, that's not what I meant!
I-I'm only saying this because I have to, but... be careful, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy...
I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so... annoying...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I-I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's creepy...
I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll...
Y-You're really annoying, but... I'll put up with you, for now...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Do I really have to sit next to you on the train?
I didn't say I liked you or anything, so don't get your hopes up!
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem I wrote for class...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever or something...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop looking at me like you can see right through me!
I didn't mean to save your life, it just kind of... happened...
Y-You're so stupid, but I guess you're my stupid...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you or anything...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smilin' at me like that!
It's not like I'm blushing or anything... *ahem*
I'm only eating with you because the cafeteria is closed...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're tolerable...
I didn't save you because I care, it's just because it was the right thing to do...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?!
I-I'm not jealous, I just don't want you talking to her...
W-Why are you looking at me like that?!
It's not like I was waiting for you or anything... I just happened to be here...
I'll only go to the festival with you if you promise not to embarrass me...
Y-You're not allowed to hold my hand! *tries to pull hand away*
I'm only saying this because I don't want you to get hurt... b-but be careful, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a nice person, not because I like you...
T-This isn't a date, okay? We're just studying together...
You're really annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I-I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so frustrating...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, that's all...
Y-You'd better not tell anyone I helped you, or I'll deny it...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself, but... but thanks, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a nice person, not because I like you!
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with food... and games...
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I-I won't say it, so don't even ask me to...
D-Do you mind not looking at me when I'm trying to concentrate?
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
G-Good job, I suppose... but don't think this means I'm going easy on you...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, just wait till you see me when I'm really mad!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even notice my feelings...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'm only saying this because it's true, but you're not as stupid as you look...
G-Get away from me, personal space!
I didn't mean to save you, it just happened that way...
S-Stop staring at me, it's creepy!
I'm not going to forget what you did, so don't think you're off the hook...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a good person, not because I like you...
T-This isn't a date, so don't even think about it...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, that's all...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I didn't mean to save you, it just happened, okay?
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only teasing you because you're so gullible, not because I enjoy your company...
G-Good luck with your exam, but don't expect me to help you study...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
I-I was just trying to protect you, not because I care about you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I-I was just, uh, making sure you didn't get lost, that's all...
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face?
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I-I didn't mean to trip and fall into your arms, it was an accident...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, got it?
D-Don't get too excited, I'm not going to start being all nice to you now...
W-Why are you staring at me? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-If you must know, I only helped because... because it was the right thing to do!
D-Don't think this means I'm going easy on you, g-got it?
Hmph, don't look so surprised. I can be nice when I want to.
Baka! Stop staring at me like that, it's c-creepy!
I didn't do it for your sake, so don't get any weird ideas!
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it.
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad.
D-Don't get too comfortable, I'm only being nice because I have to.
I-I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat, yeah.
G-Guys like you are all the same... but, um, not that I'm saying you're like that or anything.
I won't admit it, but... you're kind of... tolerable.
S-Shut up and don't look at me! I'm trying to c-concentrate.
I-If you think this means I like you or something, you're sadly mistaken.
Hmph, I'm only doing this because I feel like it, not because of you.
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this for your sake!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm doing this out of kindness, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only teasing you because you're so gullible...
D-Do you really think I care about your feelings?
I-I was just trying to help, not that I expected thanks or anything...
Y-You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to hide my true feelings?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it!
S-Stop asking me questions, it's none of your business!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I'm interested in you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Stop making me blush!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're w-wrong!

I'm not blushing, I just... have a rash, okay?
If you don't stop teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I-It's not like I care about your opinion or anything...
G-Good luck with your exam, but don't expect me to help you study!
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!

Y-You're really something else, you know that? Always getting on my nerves...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even ask...
B-Baka! Stop laughing, it's really embarrassing...
I-I swear, I'm only doing this for myself, not for your benefit...

I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself, you kn-know that!
T-This is not a date, it's just a... a study session, yeah!
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're invading my p-personal space!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't get any ideas!
I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to make fun of me, d-deal?
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'll have you know, I'm just as clever!

Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I've got news for you, baka!
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself, so just back off!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misunderstand!
If you think I'm being nice to you, you're wrong!
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
H-Hey, don't get too close! Personal space, you know?
I-I was just, uh, testing you. Yeah, that's it...
Stop looking at me like that! It's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not blushing! It's just, uh, the heat...
D-Don't tell anyone, but... I might have had fun today...
I-I didn't mean to, but... you're kind of growing on me...
Sh-Shut up and don't say anything! You'll ruin everything!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...

Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'm not impressed...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right. There's a difference, baka!
I-If you want to walk me home, it's only because it's on your way, r-right?
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
W-Why are you staring at me? Can't you see I'm trying to concentrate?

I-I'm only helping you because I p-pity you
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this out of kindness!
T-This is none of your business, so stop staring!
You're s-so annoying, but I suppose you're mildly entertaining
I'm not l-losing to you, I'm just... letting you win
Baka! Can't you see I'm busy?
I d-don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!

Y-You're not my friend, so stop acting like it!
I'm n-not going to the festival with you, but... I might show up anyway
S-Stop calling me cute, it's annoying!
I'm d-doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get excited

Y-You're really annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you...
I didn't say I liked you, so don't get your hopes up!
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
I-I mean, I was just walking by and saw you struggling, so...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping because I have to!
Baka! You're so clumsy, I swear...
I-If you must know, I was thinking about someone else when I did that...
T-That's not a smile, it's just... a twitch...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being nice to everyone...
Y-You really are dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's...
I didn't do it for your sake, g-got it?!
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face?!
I-I won't let you get away with this! Not because I care, but...

T-This doesn't mean I'm going to start being nice to you all the time, okay?
Geh, don't think this means I'm interested in you or anything...
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
I-I have better things to do than watch the sunset with you...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't tell anyone, but... I might have had fun today...

Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even see what's right in front of you...
I'm not doing this for your benefit, I'm doing it for mine!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I-If you think I'm going to go easy on you just because you're weak, you're wrong!
B-Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I-I don't need your help, but...but thanks, I guess...

I-I'm not going to forgive you that easily...
D-Don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I-I'll never admit it, but...but maybe I like you a little...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pity you...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, got it?
T-This is a one-time thing, so don't expect it again...
If anyone asks, I didn't do anything for you...
You're really d-dense, aren't you?
I-I swear, it's not like I'm looking out for you...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice...
I'm only being kind because it's my duty, that's all...
S-Stop staring at me! It's making me uncomfortable...

I-I don't know why I'm always getting stuck with you...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, it means anything...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because I wanted to...
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's embarrassing...
I'm only being nice to you because it's convenient...
D-Don't get too close! Personal space, you know?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Do I look like I care about your opinion?
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's creepy!
I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
T-That doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Don't think for a second that I'm doing this out of kindness...

Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...

Y-you're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I didn't say I trusted you, so don't get any ideas!
T-this is a one-time thing, so don't expect any special treatment!
D-don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you now...
I-I'm still mad at you, but... but maybe, just maybe, I'll consider forgiving you...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!

Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
If you think I'm being kind to you, you're wrong!
T-This is just a one-time thing, so don't expect it again!
I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me!
Gah, don't touch me! You're so clumsy!
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because I have to...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you?
I'm not mad, I'm just... passionately expressing myself!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you!
If you keep staring at me, I'll... I'll...
I'm only saying this because it's true, not because I care about you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
Hmph, don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah...
G-Good luck on your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I-I didn't buy this cake for you, I just... wanted to try a new flavor...
T-This is not a date, it's just... a study session, okay?
Baka! Don't touch me, I can take care of myself!
I-I'm only saying this because I have to, but... you're not completely useless...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Don't think I'm smiling because of you!
W-why are you looking at me? I wasn't staring at you...
D-don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-thank you... *ahem* I mean, it was nothing special...
H-hey, don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
I-if you want to eat with me, you have to sit on the other side of the table...
Y-you're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-don't think this means I like you or anything! I'm just being nice...
I-I wasn't worried about you, I just... just happened to be in the area...
W-what's with that stupid grin on your face? W-wipe it off!
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
B-baka! Don't make me say it twice, got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Don't think I'm saving you a seat on purpose!
W-Why are you looking at me? I'm just staring out the window...
I didn't buy this cake for you, I just... really like cake...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, but you're not as annoying as I thought...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, but... you're not bad at sports...
I-I was just, uh, testing the temperature of the pool... with my foot...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? I mean, not that I'm impressed...
I'm not arguing, I'm just... passionately expressing my point of view...
G-Geez, don't look so happy, it's not like I'm smiling at you...
I didn't mean to blush, it's just... the heater in here is really strong...
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? I'm just... concerned about you...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
T-That's not a gift, I just found it on the ground...
D-Do I really have to sit next to you?
I-I'm not jealous, I just don't want to see you with anyone else...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm not talking to you, I'm just... just talking to myself...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll get angry!
W-Why are you always so cheerful? It's disgusting...
D-Don't think that just because I'm speaking to you, I like you or anything...
I-I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easy to provoke...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
B-Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
I-I won't deny it, you're... somewhat useful to have around...
D-Do you mind not looking at me while I'm trying to concentrate?
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not doing it for you, I'm doing it because I want to, g-got that?
I don't know why I bother with you, but... just don't expect me to go easy on you...
T-Turn around and don't look at me, I'm trying to change...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be going the same way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
Don't think that just because I cooked for you, I'm going to start doing it all the time...
T-This isn't a date, okay? It's just a study session...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting stuck with you, but it's not like I like it or anything...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, s-so don't look at me like that...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I didn't say I liked your gift, I just said it was... nice...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and start giving me orders!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I-if you must know, I only helped you because I felt sorry for you...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not interested in you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I-If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I feel like it, not because I like you...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I won't go to the movies with you, but... but maybe I'll meet you there...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you or anything...
I-I'm only doing this for your own good, not because I care about you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, it was just a coincidence...
T-This isn't a date, it's just a... a study session...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, not because I like you...
D-Don't think that just because I smiled at you, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I was just testing you to see if you're worthy of my attention...
S-Stop making me blush, it's embarrassing...
I'd never admit it out loud, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
I'm not going to hold your hand, but... I won't stop you if you try...
Y-You're really persistent, I'll give you that...
I-I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so annoying...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? Look away!
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it wasn't p-poisonous...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me?
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I won't go to the movies with you, but I might just happen to be at the same theater...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty, not because I actually like you...
G-Get your hands off me! I can walk on my own...
I didn't mean to save you, it just kind of... happened...
D-Don't think this means I owe you one or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That doesn't mean I like you or anything!
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me?
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll get angry!
Y-You're really annoying, but...but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so...so frustrating!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just...just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-If you want to be friends, then...then you have to promise not to embarrass me...
B-Baka! Don't touch me like that! It's...it's too much!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?

Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you...

I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself, d-don't worry about it!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, but... you're not as bad as I thought.
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I was just, uh, testing your reflexes, that's all... don't read too much into it!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so d-don't even think about it!
I-I mean, if I had to choose someone to trust, it would be... you, maybe.
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off, it's embarrassing!
I-I didn't say I liked you, so don't go getting any weird ideas, g-got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same foods as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is just... just flushed from the heat...
I don't care about your opinion, but... but your taste in music isn't completely terrible...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you or anything...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not going to fall for it...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems, but... but I suppose I can help this one time...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me... uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing! I just... just have a rash, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be going to the same place!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, okay? Just a study session...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're wrong!
I-I swear, I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
You're really dense, aren't you? I'm trying to be nice here...
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's making me uncomfortable...

D-Do I really need to spell it out for you? I'm not interested!
I-I swear, it's just a coincidence that I'm sitting next to you...
S-Stop teasing me, or I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
I'm not blushing, I just...have a fever, that's all...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not!
I-I didn't mean to help you, it just sort of...happened...
D-Don't think that just because I saved you, I like you or anything...

Sh-Shut up and don't talk to me, okay?
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?

D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable!
It's not like I trust you or anything, but...
I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to make fun of me...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
I-I think I might have... l-left my book at your place...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it!
I don't know what you're talking about, so just sh-shut up!
If I'm going with you, it's just because I don't want to be alone, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, it's just a favor!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, so don't stare at me!
You're really dense, aren't you? I mean, I guess that's kind of... cute...
G-Give me back my book, I wasn't done reading it yet!
I'm not going to hold your hand, so stop asking me!
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself, so just back off!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I mean, I was just passing by and saw you struggling...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start doing favors for you!
H-Hey, stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
Baka! Can't you see I'm busy?! Don't bother me!
I-If you must know, I was only helping because... because it was the right thing to do!
S-Shut up and don't look at me like you know something!
W-Why are you still standing there?! Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?!
I-I didn't do it for your sake, g-got it?! It was just a coincidence!
D-Dont think I'm going to go easy on you just because... just because you're you!
G-Gah, stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'm only telling you this because... because you need to know, okay?! Don't read too much into it!
S-Stop making me feel like this! It's so... so frustrating!
I-I'll never admit it, but... but maybe I was a little happy to see you...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm still not going to go out with you or anything!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship!
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I'm not jealous, I just... don't want you talking to her, okay?
I-If you want to eat lunch together, it's only because I don't want to eat alone...
Y-You're not going to tell anyone about this, are you? It's a secret...
I don't care about your opinion, b-but... thanks for noticing me, I guess...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that! I'm not blushing!
I wasn't thinking about you, I was just... lost in thought...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
If you think I'm being kind to you, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything...
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because I have to...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you!
I'm only being nice to you because it's convenient for me...
Y-You'd better not tell anyone about this, or I'll deny it!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that!
I'm not going to go easy on you just because you're weak...
D-Don't expect me to always be there to help you, got it?
I-I mean, I was just in the area, that's all...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start doing favors for you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
T-That doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-If you tell anyone I did this, I'll deny it...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even figure out something simple...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, that's all...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
Y-You're really getting on my nerves, you know that?
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, okay?
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's annoying...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, s-so don't look at me...
I-I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to make fun of me...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you for now...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right, g-got it?
W-Why are you staring at me? Can't you see I'm busy?
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
H-Hey, stop smiling at me! It's annoying!
Baka! I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
T-That's not a compliment, so don't think you can flirt with me!
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
I-If you must know, I was just... worried about you. Yeah, that's it...
S-Stop looking at me like that! You're making me blush...
I-I didn't say I liked you, so don't go getting any ideas!
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-I swear, I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop staring at me!
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
I-I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself...
D-Don't think you can just waltz in here and steal my heart, baka!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Why are you looking at me? I-I was just, uh, looking in your direction...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just, uh, the heat...
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of, sort of, a little bit interesting...
G-Good job, I suppose... but don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you might be, possibly, my friend...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, okay?
Baka! Stop smiling at me!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't twist my words!
If I'm going to the movies with you, it's just because I want to see the film, got it?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that!
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything! I'm just being nice...
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
I'll only give you my notes because I don't want you to fail, not because I care...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I feel sorry for you...
I didn't save you because I like you, I just didn't want to see you get hurt, okay?
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, that's all...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'd never admit it out loud, but... you're kind of useful to have around...
G-Good job, I suppose... but don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't even think about it!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
You're so annoying, yet... I don't know, maybe I'll tolerate you...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, it's just a favor...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I'll go to the movies with you, but only because I want to see the film, not because of you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous...
I-I'm just worried about you, that's all... Don't read too much into it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face?
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't care!
It's not like I was waiting for you or anything... I just arrived at the same time, that's all.
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being nice.
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
G-Geez, stop looking at me like I'm some kind of idiot!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... yeah, that's it.
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything... I'm just relieved you're not dead.
Baka! Don't touch me! I can handle myself!
I-I don't know why I'm always getting stuck with you, but it's not like I like it or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't care!
T-That's not a compliment, so don't think you can flatter me!
If I'm with you, it's only because I have no one better to hang out with...
D-Don't think this means I trust you or anything...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite...
G-Good luck with your stupid project, like I care...
I'm not watching you, I just happen to be looking in your direction...
I don't need your help, but I'll accept it anyway...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...

Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'd never admit it out loud, but... you're not as stupid as you look...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm not going to forgive you that easily, baka...
Y-You'd better not expect me to start being all nice to you now...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study!
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, it was just a coincidence...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
Why are you smiling at me? It's really annoying...
I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I don't care about your opinion, but... but your hair looks nice today...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
Stop calling me cute! I'm not cute, I'm just... just energetic...
You're really slow, aren't you? I had to wait for you the whole time...
I didn't mean to blush, it's just... just the heat...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
B-Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I didn't make this bento for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't think that just because I saved you, I like you or anything...
I-I was just, uh, testing my new recipe, and you just happened to be here...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I didn't mean to blush, it's just... the heat, yeah...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
I-I bought this cake because I wanted to eat it, not because it's your birthday...
S-Stop smiling at me, it's really annoying...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, so don't get excited...
I don't know why I'm always getting caught up in your problems...
H-Hey, don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
You're really dense, aren't you? I'm only being nice because...
I swear, if you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?...
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
G-Good luck with your thing, not that I care or anything...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're w-wrong!
I'm not being kind, I just didn't want to see you f-fail!
Sh-shut up and don't mention this to anyone, got it?
I did it because... because I had nothing better to do, that's all!
You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only spending time with you because...
I-I swear, it's not like I'm looking out for you or anything!
If you say one more stupid thing, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you!
You're really getting on my nerves, but... but I won't back down!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...

Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, but... thanks, I guess...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite... there's a difference!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not f-funny...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy! You're going to hurt yourself...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks for offering, I suppose...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem...
Why are you looking at me? I-I didn't do anything...
I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
I-I'm not jealous, I just don't want you wasting your time with her...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
I-I mean, if you want to go to the movies, I suppose I could... accompany you...
Stop teasing me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I-If you must know, I did notice you were gone, but that's all...
Y-You're really annoying when you're happy, you know that?
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
You're so annoying, but I suppose you're mildly entertaining...
I didn't do it for you, I did it because I felt like it...
T-Too bad you're not smart enough to figure it out yourself...
I'm only being nice to you because I pity you...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not going easy on you...
I-I'm just trying to help, not that you deserve it...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even notice...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
S-Stop smiling at me, it's distracting...
I'm not going to admit it, but you're... tolerable...
I-I'll never admit I like spending time with you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is just naturally red, okay?
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I p-pity you...
D-Don't think that just because we're together, it means I like you...
I-I was just testing you to see if you're worthy, that's all...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that I care or anything...
I-I don't know why I'm saying this, but... be careful, okay?
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? W-Wipe it off!
I'd never admit it out loud, but... you're not as bad as I thought...

T-This is not a date, it's just a... a study session!
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're wrong!
I don't know why I'm always getting stuck with you, it's so frustrating!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I swear, I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
I'll never admit it, but... but you're not as bad as I thought...
S-Shut up and don't look at me! I'm trying to concentrate...

Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, so don't get your hopes up...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
I-I swear, I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, not because I want to...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not blushing, it's just my face is a little... hot...
I-I didn't buy this cake for you, I just happened to have extra money...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm only going to the movies with you because my friends cancelled on me...
I-I don't know why you're smiling, but it's really annoying...
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to be all cheerful about it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to be alone...
Y-You're really d-dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, s-so don't look at me!
G-Geez, can't you see I'm busy? Don't bother me!
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll...
Y-You really are something else, aren't you? Always getting on my nerves!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I w-want to...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pity you...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop making me worry about you!
I'm not doing this for your sake, g-got it?
If anyone asks, I was just in the area... coincidentally...
You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I-I won't say it, so don't even ask...
W-Why are you looking at me like that?!
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice because...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't expect it...

Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, I just didn't want to see you get hurt...
T-This gift is not from me, I just found it on the ground...
If you think I'm going to start going easy on you just because we're friends, you're wrong...
I'm only helping you with your homework because I don't want to see you fail...
D-Don't think that just because I'm smiling, I'm happy to see you...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I didn't mean to fall asleep on your shoulder, it just happened...
I'm not going to hold your hand, but I'll walk with you to make sure you don't get lost...
I-It's not like I trust you or anything, I just don't have a choice...
Baka! Don't touch me, I'm not a doll...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you?
It's not like I'm concerned about you, but... be careful, okay?
Geez, don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice...
I-I didn't say I'd go out with you, so don't get your hopes up!
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's creepy!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, that's all...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I-I swear, I'm only helping you because it's my duty...
Baka! Don't touch me, personal space!
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a study session...
I don't know why I bother with you, you're so... so... ugh!
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I'm not laughing at your joke, I'm just... appreciating the effort...
Y-You didn't think I was going to let you eat the last piece of cake, did you?
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, even if it is a really scary movie...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me blush!
I'm only walking with you because it's safer at night, not because I enjoy your company...
I didn't buy you a gift, it's just something I found lying around...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!

T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a study session...
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I won't admit it, but... you're kind of strong...
D-Don't think that just because I saved you, I'm going to start going easy on you...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
I'll never confess to you, so don't even think about it...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?...
I'll only say this once, so listen carefully: I... I trust you...
Don't get too full of yourself just because I asked for your help...
I'm not doing it for you, I'm doing it because I want to... not that it's any of your business...

I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
G-Good luck on your exam, but don't expect me to help you study or anything.
I-If you keep staring at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can touch my hair or anything...

I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible.
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? Personal space, please!
It's not like I'm worried about you or anything, but be careful, okay?
G-Geez, don't make such a big deal out of it, I just lent you my favorite book...
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat. Yeah, that's it.
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you or anything...
Baka! Don't touch me, I can walk on my own!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, I just didn't want to see you get hurt...
S-Shut up and don't look at me, I'm trying to study...
If I'm helping you with your homework, it's not because I care about you, it's because I care about grades...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, that's all...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but why are you talking to her?
I didn't buy this cake for you, I just happened to have extra money and wanted something sweet...
If you think I'm going to start being all nice to you just because you saved me, you're wrong...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I'm only admitting this because I have to, but... you're not as annoying as I thought you'd be...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? I was just, uh, looking at the sky...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, but... you're not as annoying as I thought...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, I'll go easy on you...
I-I was just trying to protect you, that's all... don't read too much into it...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat, yeah...
G-Good luck on your exam, but don't expect me to help you study...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easily embarrassed...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because... because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Shut up and don't look at me, I'm trying to concentrate...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're not as stupid as I thought...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat, yeah...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
Y-You're really annoying, but... I guess you're not so bad...
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because... I wanted to, okay?
Stop staring at me, it's creepy!
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
Baka! Don't think I'm smiling because of you!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me, I'm trying to study!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping you because...
I-if you keep staring at me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a...a friendly outing.
H-Hey, don't touch me! I can walk on my own.
I-I'm not blushing! It's just...the heat, yeah.
Y-You're so annoying, but...but I suppose you're not all bad.
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, baka!
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it!
S-Stop looking at me with those stupid eyes!
I-I'm only doing this for myself, not for you!
B-Besides, I'm the one who's really in charge here, not you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so... annoying!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite. Yeah, that's it.
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I didn't say I wanted to be your partner, I just didn't want to be alone...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's creepy!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
G-Geez, don't get so excited, it's just a small favor...
I-I didn't mean to blush, it's just... the heat, yeah.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're even more stupid than I thought...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
Sh-shut up and don't talk to me, I'm busy!
It's not like I care about you or anything, but... be careful, okay?
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
You're so annoying, but... I guess you're not all bad...
G-Geez, stop looking at me like that, it's creepy!
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any weird ideas...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying...
I didn't make this bento for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're... you're wrong!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
Y-You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
It's not like I care about your opinions or anything, but... maybe you're right this time...
I didn't blush, it's just... the heat...
I'm not going to hold your hand, but... maybe just for a second...
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll... I'll deny it!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't make this bento for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
T-This is not a date, got it? Just two friends hanging out...
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I might have drawn a picture of you...
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-If you want to walk with me, you have to promise not to talk to me...
Y-You're really annoying, but... I guess you're not that bad...
I didn't say I liked you or anything, I just... appreciate your efforts...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, but... you can hold mine if you want...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this out of kindness!
Baka! You're so careless, someone has to look out for you...
I-it's not like I'm going to tell you my secrets or anything...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
If I'm with you, it's because I want to be, not because I need you...
D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just forget it...
G-Good luck with that, you're going to need it...
I-I'm only doing this because it's the right thing to do, not for you...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
I-I have to go, I have... uh, things to do...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
T-That's not a compliment, it's just a fact! You're really annoying!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want!
I'm not going to fall for your charming smile, s-so don't even try!
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you need it or anything...
I-I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to talk during the film!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm only being nice to you because I feel guilty, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all excited!
I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so... frustrating!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to be nice!
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right!
D-Don't think this means I trust you or anything, I'm just... lending you my book...
I-I didn't mean to blush, it's just... the heat, yeah...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Always getting under my skin...
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of... tolerable, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? Look away!
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess.
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, okay?
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's distracting...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, that's all...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you, for now.
I'm not going to hold your hand, so d-don't even ask!

D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that...
G-Geez, can't you see I'm busy? Don't bother me...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... tolerant...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll...
D-Don't expect me to always be there for you, okay?
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...

S-Stop teasing me! I'm not blushing or anything...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only walking with you because it's on my way home, don't think it's a date or something...
Y-You're really annoying when you're happy, just so you know...
I-I didn't say I liked you, I just said you're not as annoying as I thought...

I didn't mean to blush, it's just the heat, okay?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're invading my p-personal space.
I-it's not like I trust you or anything, but I suppose you're not completely useless.
G-Geez, don't be so loud, you're going to wake up the whole neighborhood!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because I want to, s-so don't get any wrong ideas.
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off, it's distracting.
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me, b-because you can't.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...

If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I p-pity you...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
Stop teasing me, it's not f-funny!

Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being polite...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
G-Good luck, I guess... Not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not going to thank you or anything, but... thanks, I suppose...
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it for myself, g-got it?
Y-You'd better not tell anyone about this, or I'll deny it...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...

St-stop looking at me with those eyes! It's embarrassing!
You're really annoying, but... but I won't let you get hurt!
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because it's my duty!
D-don't get the wrong idea, I'm not being kind!
I'm only teaching you this because you're so... so clueless!
If you think you can just w-waltz in here and...
I-I won't forgive you if you get in my way!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I just arrived at the same time, that's all...

Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and steal the show!
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to!
Baka! You're so clumsy, can't you even walk straight?

T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
You're really annoying, but... I suppose you're not that bad...

You think you're so smart, don't you? W-well, you're not...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me n-nervous...
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything, but... maybe you're not as stupid as I thought...
G-Geez, stop teasing me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I'm not being quiet because I'm shy, I'm just... thinking deeply, that's all...
If you must know, I was worried about you, b-but don't think this means I like you or anything...

I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, but if you're scared, I suppose I can... tolerate it...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you need it or anything...
I-I'm only giving you this gift because I didn't want it anymore, not because I like you...
D-Don't thank me, I didn't do it for you, I did it for... for myself...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study!
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, it was just a coincidence...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners for this project, it means I like you...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You'd better not tell anyone I was nice to you, or I'll deny it...
I didn't mean to smile at you, it was just a reflex...
I'm not going to hold your hand, even if it is a really scary movie...
I-I'm only going to the beach with you because I want to get some sun...
Baka! Don't touch me, I can take care of myself...
I-It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but who's that girl you're talking to?
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because... because I felt like it, okay?
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything!
If you tell anyone I cooked for you, I'll d-deny it!
I-I'm not being nice, I'm just being... efficient!
D-Drop it, I don't want to talk about it!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you?
I'm only going to the festival with you because... because I didn't have anything else to do!
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a good person, not because I like you...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself, b-but thanks for offering...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, s-so don't worry about it...
D-Don't touch me, you'll get germs or something...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, even if it is dark outside...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're wrong, b-baka...
I'm only playing this game with you because I want to win, not because I'm having fun...
I don't care about your feelings, but d-don't get hurt, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be going the same way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, so don't even think about it...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle myself...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty, not because I like you...
G-Geez, stop staring at me! It's creepy...
I-I didn't mean to, it just slipped out... Don't read too much into it...
If you think you can handle it, then g-go ahead and try... But don't come crying to me when you fail...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with only the two of us...
You're so clueless, I swear... I'm only being nice to you because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't think that just because I'm sitting next to you, I'm interested in you or anything...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems, but I suppose I'll help you... again...
Y-You shouldn't be so reckless all the time, it's frustrating to watch...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, that's all...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything... I mean, you're probably going to fail...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
T-That doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite...
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm not interested!
I-I'm only saying this because I don't want you to get the wrong idea...
G-Geez, can't you just leave me alone for once?
I'm not sure why I bother with you, you never listen anyway...
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything, okay?
I-I swear, you're more trouble than you're worth...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything...
I swear, it's not like I'm looking out for you... it's just coincidence...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to thank you or anything, but... you're not as useless as I thought...
G-Good job, I suppose... but don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I-I didn't mean to say that... just forget it, okay?
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it till the end of time...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face?
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, okay?
Hmph, don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you
I-I was just trying to protect you, that's all...
D-Don't misunderstand, I was just concerned about your well-being
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, that's all...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll...
W-Why do you always have to be so clueless?!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem I found...
If you think I'm cute, it's because I'm angry, not because I like you...
I don't know what you're talking about, and even if I did, I wouldn't tell you...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're... distracting...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun...
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it...
Y-You're not going to tell anyone about this, are you?...
I swear, I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail...
It's not like I trust you or anything, I just... need your help for now...
D-Don't think this means I owe you one, because I don't...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
D-don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
Y-you're really dense, aren't you?
I didn't say I'd go out with you, I just said I'd consider it...
S-stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable!
I-I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?
D-don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I'm only being nice to you because it's convenient...
G-guys like you are always so clueless...
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
Y-you're really lucky I'm in a good mood today...
D-don't get too close, I might just... never mind.
I-it's not like I care about you or anything, but be careful, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
T-That's not a gift, I just found it on the ground and thought you might want it...
Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
You're so clueless, it's almost... almost... ugh, never mind!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite, there's a difference!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're invading my personal space...
I didn't say I liked you, I just said you're not as annoying as I thought...
G-Get your own food, I'm not buying lunch for you!
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
If I'm with you, it's only because I have no one better to hang out with...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're invading my personal space...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?!
You're really dense, aren't you? I already told you I don't like you...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty, not because I actually like you...
G-Good luck with your exam, but don't expect me to help you study or anything...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm helping you out of the goodness of my heart...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop making me repeat myself!
I'm only doing this because I have to, g-got it?
If you think I'm being nice to you, you're sadly mistaken...
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything, okay?
I-I swear, I'm only tolerating you because...
D-Don't look at me like that! It's embarrassing...
I'm not blushing! I just... have a rash, okay?
If you tell anyone I helped you, I'll d-deny it...
I-I don't know why I'm even bothering with you...
Y-You're not worth my time, but I'll spare a minute...
I'm only talking to you because I have no one else to talk to...
D-Don't get too excited, it's not like I'm going to start being nice to you...
I-It's not like I'm saying this because I care or anything...
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm going to start going easy on you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be standing here...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help!
If I'm with you, it's only because I have to be, got it?
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm only doing this because...
I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that!
It's not like my heart was racing or anything... I just had a little too much caffeine, that's all...
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat, yeah, that's it...
Y-You're not going to start thinking you're special just because I... uh, never mind...
I wasn't trying to protect you or anything, I just didn't want to see you get hurt and make a fuss...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, but... maybe, just maybe, I'll consider going to the festival with you...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? I'm not doing anything!
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?!
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
S-Stop teasing me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I-I didn't say I liked you or anything, so don't get any ideas...
G-Good luck on your exam, not that I care or anything...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping because...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be here...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Do I really have to say it? F-Fine, thanks for the help...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that! It's embarrassing...
I-I'm only going with you because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not...
I wasn't staring at you, I was just... just looking in your general direction...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, got it?
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
I-It's not like I'm helping you because I like you or anything!
D-Don't think this means I'm going easy on you, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
Stop looking at me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
F-Fine, I'll go with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this for myself...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... efficient...
G-Get away from me! I need some space...
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm helping you because I like you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because...
Baka! You're so clumsy, I swear...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you?
I don't care about your opinion, but...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only going to the festival with you because...
D-Don't touch me, you'll get me dirty...
I-I'm not scared, I'm just being cautious...
Y-You're really annoying, but...
I won't admit it, but you're kind of...
I'm not doing it for your sake, I'm doing it for...
B-Baka, stop teasing me!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I didn't make this cake for you, I just... happened to have extra ingredients...
W-Why are you looking at me? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
T-This is not a date, got it? Just a... a study session...
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
Y-You're really something else, aren't you? Always getting into trouble...
I didn't say I liked you, I just said you're... tolerable...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of your company...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!

W-Why are you looking at me? Don't you have something better to do?
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't care!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... but I suppose you're not all bad.
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not!
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas!
G-Geez, stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess.
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you mess it up...
T-That's not a gift, I just found it and thought you might need it...
Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll...I'll...
D-Don't touch me, you'll get me dirty!
I'm only talking to you because I have to, not because I want to...
Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I-I'm not going to forgive you that easily, got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, it was just a coincidence...
W-Why are you always so close to me? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you...
D-Do you mind not sitting next to me on the bus? I need some space...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but who's that girl you're talking to?
I-I'm not cold, I just like wearing my jacket inside, okay?
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I didn't bake these cookies for you, I just happened to have extra...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not blushing, it's just my face...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Don't think that just because I smiled at you, I'm going to start being all nice and friendly...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
Y-You're really clumsy, aren't you? Always tripping over your own feet...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
G-Geez, can't you see I'm busy? Don't bother me!
I'm only going to the beach with you because I want to get some sun...
Y-You're not going to start teasing me again, are you?
I swear, every time I'm around you, something weird happens...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
Baka! Don't touch me, you'll get me dirty!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-I was just, uh, testing the mic, not singing to you...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I suppose...
S-Stop looking at me like I'm some kind of cute animal!
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, not because I like your company...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-I didn't say I liked your gift, I just said it was... interesting...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's being nice...
I'm not blushing, I just have a, uh, a fever or something...
I-I was just trying to protect you, not that I care about you or anything...
Baka! Don't touch me like that, it's too... familiar...
I-I don't know why I'm helping you, baka!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to!
Y-You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I-It's not like I'm going to go easy on you just because you're cute!
D-Dumb idiot, don't get the wrong idea!
I'm s-still mad at you, got it?
J-Just don't expect me to start being all nice to you now...
I-I won't forgive you that easily!
W-Why are you looking at me like that?! Stop it!
Y-You're really getting on my nerves, but... but I won't back down!
I-I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
D-Don't think you can just waltz in here and charm me with your stupid smile!

D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite.
G-Good luck, I guess. Not that you'll need it.
If you get hurt, don't come crying to me...
I'm not worried about you, I just don't want to have to deal with the paperwork...
You're so clumsy, I swear... Someone has to look out for you.
D-Do you really think I'd go out of my way for you? Ha!
I-I mean, you're not completely useless, I suppose...
Stop staring at me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I don't know why I bother with you... You never listen anyway.
Fine, I'll help you. But don't expect me to be all smiles about it.
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not being nice to you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you!
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice, I've forgiven you!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat!
Y-You're so annoying, but I'll help you anyway...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it!
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
D-Don't get too close, personal space, you know?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I-I was just, uh, testing the cookies to make sure they're not poisoned...
Y-You think I'm cute? H-Huh? Wh-what are you talking about?
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's, uh, making me uncomfortable...
I-I didn't say I liked you or anything! Don't misunderstand!
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? W-Wipe it off!
I-I'm not blushing! It's just, uh, the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to try anything...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start going easy on you, got it?
I-I was just worried about you, okay? Don't make a big deal out of it...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not sweet on you or anything!
T-That's not what I meant! Don't twist my words!
Baka! Can't you see I'm busy?! Don't bother me!
I-If you must know, I was just... just testing you. Yeah, that's it.
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face?! Wipe it off!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... just being polite. There's a difference!
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you?! Ugh, fine.
Y-You're really annoying, you know that?! But, um, don't stop...
I-I didn't do it for your sake, got it?! It was just a coincidence...
S-Stop staring at me! You're making me uncomfortable...
I-If I help you, don't think it means I like you or anything...!
D-Don't get too full of yourself, okay?! You're not that special...
W-Why are you still standing there?! Can't you see I'm busy?!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't make this bento for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
T-This isn't a date, it's just a... a study session...
If you think I'm doing this because I like you, you're wrong...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-get it straight...
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop smiling at me...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I didn't save you because I care about you, I just... didn't want to see you get hurt...
T-This is not a gift, it's just something I didn't need anymore...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible.
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but who's that person you're talking to?
I'm not being mean, I'm just being honest. You're really clumsy, you know?
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... be careful, okay?
G-Geez, don't make such a big deal out of it. It was just a small favor...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
W-Why are you looking at me like that? Can't you see I'm trying to concentrate?
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm going to start doing it all the time...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!

Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?

You're so annoying, but... but I'll sit with you at lunch...
I-I swear, it's not like I'm blushing or anything...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
G-Geez, don't make me repeat myself, okay? Just leave me alone...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be going to the same place...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I didn't save you because I like you, I just didn't want to see you get hurt...
T-That's not a gift, I just found it and thought you might want it...
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're wrong...
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
I didn't mean to yell at you, it's just... never mind...
I-If you must know, I was worried about you, okay?
Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...

D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
T-This is just a one-time thing, so don't get your hopes up!
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to help you study or anything...
I-I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because I want to!
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad.
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this, got it?
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, okay?!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only doing this because I have to, g-got it?
It's not like I care about you or anything... *looks away*
S-Shut up and don't talk to me, okay?
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not that bad, I guess
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
I'm only being nice to you because... uh, because I feel sorry for you
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything, okay?!
I-I'd never say this out loud, but... you're kind of... interesting
B-Baka! Don't touch me! *pushes away*

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being polite...
I-I swear, I'm not blushing... it's just the heat...
J-Just because I'm talking to you doesn't mean I like you...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I-I don't know why I'm helping you, just don't expect it again...
T-This cake is... um, really sweet. Not that I made it for you...
Y-You're so clumsy, I swear... Someone has to take care of you...
I'm only lending you my notes because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything... I just don't want to see you fail...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I just... arrived at the same time, that's all...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Always getting into trouble...
I-I'll accompany you to the movies, but just as friends, okay? Don't read too much into it...
B-Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!

I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're kind of useful to have around...
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's embarrassing...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
D-Don't think you can just waltz in here and... and make me happy or something!
I-I'll never forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pity you...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, g-got it?
If anyone asks, I was just... uh, studying...
You're so clumsy, I swear... I'll just help you this once.

Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice because...
Gah, stop staring at me! You're making me blush...
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?

D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you now...
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad.
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you need it or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I-I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's creepy!
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
D-Don't get too close, I don't want to catch your cold...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I didn't do it for your sake, I just happened to be in the area...
B-Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? I'm not doing anything...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but who's that person you're talking to?
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself...
D-Do you really think I'm that kind of person?-
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you or anything...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not that bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
W-Why do you always have to be so close to me? Can't you just give me some space?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just didn't want to stay home alone...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even notice my feelings...
I won't admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
Geh, don't touch me! I can do it myself...
I-I'm not jealous or anything, but why are you talking to her?
D-Do you really think I'd fall for something so obvious?...
I'm not doing it for your sake, I'm doing it because I want to...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that! It's embarrassing...
I'll never say it out loud, but... you might be kind of interesting...
Y-You're really getting on my nerves, but... I'll tolerate you...
I won't forgive you if you tell anyone, but... I had fun today...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I only did it because I had to!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, just forget it!
It's not like I care about you, but... but don't get hurt, okay?
T-That's not what I meant! Don't twist my words!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you!
D-Don't look at me like that! I-I can take care of myself!
You're so... so annoying! But, uh, don't die or anything...
I-I won't say it, so don't even think about it! You're not that special!
G-Geez, stop making me blush! It's not like I'm embarrassed or anything...
I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of... useful to have around...
Sh-Shut up and don't tease me! I'm not that easy to provoke!
I-I'll do it, but not because you asked me to! I just happen to want to do it, that's all...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be going the same way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I-I won't admit it, but you're kind of... tolerable...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't look at me!
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
G-Good job, I guess... but don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
You're really dense, aren't you? I mean, I'm not saying I like you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even notice my feelings...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me blush...
I'm not being stubborn, I just know what's best...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... being polite...
T-This doesn't mean I trust you, got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I'm not embarrassed, I'm just... passionate...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because...
You're so... so... annoying! But I'll help you anyway...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're not completely useless...
T-This is a one-time thing, don't expect me to always...
I'm not being kind, I'm just... temporarily insane...
Baka! Don't make me regret this...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a study session...
I don't know why I'm always stuck with you, it's so frustrating...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
I'm not being kind to you, I just don't want to see you fail...
You're really d-dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I swear, I'm only doing this because it's my duty...
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's making me uncomfortable...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
It's not like I trust you or anything, I just don't have a choice...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Do I look like I'm interested in your stupid game?
Baka! Don't touch me, I can walk on my own!
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I didn't make this cake for you, it's just... a coincidence...
W-Why are you staring at me? It's creepy!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being nice...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat!
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I'll go to the movies with you...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just... didn't hate it...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I swear, I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even think about it!
I-I didn't say I liked you or anything, so don't get any ideas...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only eating lunch with you because the cafeteria is crowded...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so... frustrating...
D-Do you mind not sitting next to me? You're taking up too much space...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'm not impressed...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, that's all...
W-Why do you always have to be so... so cheerful? It's exhausting...
I-I didn't mean to trip and fall into your arms, it was an accident...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, no matter what!
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
T-That doesn't mean I'm going to go easy on you, though!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I won't admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought.
D-Don't get too full of yourself, okay?
I'm only being nice to you because I feel sorry for you...
It's not like I'm blushing or anything, stupid!
I-I'll never forgive you if you tell anyone about this!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you?
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right!
D-Don't think we're friends or anything just because we talked!
I-I'll do it, but not because I want to, because I have to!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
S-Shut up and don't talk to me, okay?
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be here at the same time...
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want...
I'm not blushing, it's just my face is a little... hot...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... I had a really bad day yesterday...
I'm only giving you this advice because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Why are you staring at me?!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're somewhat useful...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I did it for myself, not for you, so don't get the wrong idea...
Geez, stop smiling at me, it's creepy...
I-I won't admit it, but you're... somewhat tolerable...
D-Don't get too close, I might... might bite you...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but...
Y-You're not as stupid as I thought, I'll give you that...
I'm only going with you because I have nothing better to do...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'll never forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
T-That's not the point! Just stop smiling at me!
Baka! Can't you see I'm busy?
I-If you must know, I was just... um, testing the food...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, okay? I'm just being nice...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I swear, I'm not blushing... it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, you know that?
I-If I'm going with you, it's just because I don't want to be alone...
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'm not going to forgive you that easily, got it?
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think that just because I'm sitting next to you, I'm interested!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I-If you must know, I was just... uh, testing the temperature of the pool...
Y-You really are clueless, aren't you? I was just trying to protect you!
S-Shut up and don't talk to me, I'm busy!
I-I didn't mean to trip and fall into your arms, it was an accident!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
W-Why are you smiling at me? It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything!
I-I was just, uh, looking for something in your eyes... like, a bug or something...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself! But... thanks, I guess...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, but... you're not as bad as I thought you'd be...
I-I mean, I was just in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd drop by...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you!
Baka! You're so clumsy, I swear...
I-It's not like I'm going to cook for you or anything, but...
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face?!
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it, okay?!
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, got it?
I-I'm only going to this festival with you because my friends are busy...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that! I'm just... just trying to help...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
W-Why are you making such a big deal out of this? It's not like it's a date or anything...
I-I don't know why I'm even bothering with you, but... just be careful, okay?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me... uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, I just didn't want to see you get hurt...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
Why are you looking at me like that? I'm not blushing or anything...
I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't think that just because we're partners for this project, it means we're... you know...
I was just, uh, testing my cooking skills, and you just happened to be there to taste it...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not jealous or anything...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
It's not like I was waiting for you or anything, I just happened to be in the area...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
I just don't want to see you get hurt, that's all... don't read too much into it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, okay? Just a study session...
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice because...
I-I swear, I'm not doing this because I like you...
Baka! You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to help?
T-This is the last time I'm doing something for you, g-got it?
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself... probably
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
T-This isn't a date, so don't even think about it...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
Sh-shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... tolerant...
D-Don't misunderstand, I'm not interested in you or anything...
If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I-it's not like I care about your opinion or anything...
G-Give me back my book, I wasn't done reading it yet...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop looking at me like that, it's embarrassing...
I didn't make this bento for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
Stop teasing me, or I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being nice...
I won't go to the movies with you, but... but I'll meet you there...
It's not like I was waiting for you, I just... arrived at the same time...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you...
I didn't buy this cake for your birthday, it's just... a coincidence...
G-Get out of my face, before I... before I lose my temper...
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me, it's... distracting...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it wasn't p-poisonous
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you
It's not like I'm excited to see you or anything... *gulps*
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right
Y-You're not going to start thinking we're friends now, are you?
I'm only giving you this gift because I didn't want it anyway...
G-Geez, stop making such a big deal out of it...
I didn't mean to save you, it just sort of... happened
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, okay?
I swear, I'm only watching this movie because it's a classic, not because you recommended it...
D-Don't even think about telling anyone I was nice to you...
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, shut up!
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
I'm only going to the beach with you because I need to get some sun...
Y-You'd better not expect me to play any games with you, I'm only here to watch...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems, baka!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!

T-That's not what I meant! Don't misunderstand!
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm not interested!
I-I was just, uh, testing your reflexes, that's all... Don't read into it!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'm not blushing! It's just, uh, the heat... Y-Yeah, that's it...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that I care or anything...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, I'll go easy on you!
I-I don't know what you're talking about! I'm not jealous, no way...
B-Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same music as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I didn't make this bento for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but why are you talking to her?
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, even if it is a crowded train...
S-Shut up and don't look at me, I'm trying to concentrate...
I-If you keep staring at me like that, I'll... I'll...
Y-You really are an idiot, aren't you? Falling for that trick...
I didn't save you because I like you, I just didn't want to see you get hurt...
D-Don't think this means I owe you one, because I don't...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...

T-This is a one-time thing, don't expect it again!
If you tell anyone I did this, I'll deny it...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand through this, got it?
D-Don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing...
You're so clueless, it's almost... admirable?
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because it's convenient...
Y-You're not going to take this the wrong way, are you?
I'm not being 'sweet', I'm just being efficient...
G-Get away from me, you're being too close!
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not that bad, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get too excited...
I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even take a hint...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
J-Just because I'm sitting next to you doesn't mean anything...
I'm only eating with you because I'm starving, not because I want to...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's creepy...
I-I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
T-This gift is not from me, I found it on the ground...
D-Do you think I'm just going to fall for your charming smile? Please...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, I wasn't blushing...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to talk to me...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I just love the food at that restaurant...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misunderstand...
If I'm with you, it's only because I have nothing better to do...
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything... Ugh!
You're so annoying, but... but I'll go to the movies with you...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
I-I was just testing you to see if you're worthy... of my friendship...
Stop looking at me like that! You're making me nervous...
I don't need your help, but... thanks for offering, I suppose...
T-Today was a terrible day, and it's all your fault...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is not for you, so don't even think about eating it!
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't need your help, I can do it myself, you idiot!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't tease me!
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's creepy!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, okay? Just a study session...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting stuck with you, but it's not like I like it...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, s-so don't look at me like that...
I-I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to tease me...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you or anything...
I-I swear, I'm only doing this for myself, not for you...
B-Baka! Don't touch me! I can do it myself...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of... t-tolerable...
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be going the same way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-I was just, uh, testing the dessert to make sure it's not poisoned...
Y-You think I'm cute? H-Hmph, don't be ridiculous!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that! I'm not blushing...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? I was obviously trying to help...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think this means I owe you one or anything...
I-I was just trying to protect you, that's all... don't read too much into it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I have to be...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I won't admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, but... you're kind of okay, I guess...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, s-so don't look at me!
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to help you study...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
D-Don't get too excited, but... I might actually start to enjoy your company...
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone, but... I had fun today...
Baka! Don't think that just because I'm being nice, I've forgotten about all the times you've annoyed me!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
Baka! Don't think I'm smiling because of you!
W-Why do you always have to be so close to me?
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping you because...
I-I don't need your protection, got it?
T-That's not a compliment, you idiot!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but...
I-I won't go out with you, no matter what!
D-Don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing!
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face?
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you!
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I don't care about your opinion, baka!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
If I'm blushing, it's just because I'm allergic to stupid people...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're invading my personal space...
I don't know what you're talking about, and even if I did, I wouldn't tell you...
I'm not being stubborn, I just know what's best for me, and that's not you...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even think about it...
W-Why are you staring at me? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't care about your opinions, but if you must know, I think your hair looks stupid like that...
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, not because I enjoy your company...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Shut up and don't look at me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I-I was just, uh, testing your reaction... Yeah, that's it...
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time...
I'm not blushing! It's just, uh, the heat...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm expecting a thank you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I'll go to the movies with you...
I'm not doing this for you, I'm doing it for myself... shut up!
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I-I don't like you or anything, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
D-Don't tell anyone, but... I had fun today...
I'm only saying this because I have to, but... you look nice today...
I-It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I only helped you because... because I didn't want to see you fail, okay?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Sh-Shut up and don't mention this to anyone, understand?
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas!
D-Don't get too close, I might... might get annoyed!
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
St-Stop making me blush, you idiot!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... just being polite, that's all!
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
J-Just don't expect me to start being all sweet and friendly, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, I just didn't want it to bite me...
S-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I think your music is kinda... good...
If I'm helping you with your homework, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
T-This isn't a date, it's just a coincidence that we're eating together...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever or something...
D-Don't think that just because I lent you my umbrella, I'm interested in you...
I-I don't know why I'm saying this, but be careful on your way home, okay?
You're really annoying, but I guess you're not as bad as I thought...
I didn't mean to, but I think I might have... grown accustomed to having you around...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop looking at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just didn't want to see you get hurt...
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I might have drawn a picture of you...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-If you don't stop teasing me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
Y-You're really annoying, but...but I guess you're not all bad...
I-It's not like I was waiting for you or anything, I just happened to be in the area...
S-Stop calling me cute, it's infuriating!
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but...but I think I might trust you...
D-Don't expect me to always be there for you, I have my own life too, you know!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess.
T-Too bad for you, I'm not going to fall for your charms!
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? Personal space, please!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not!
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty, d-don't think it's because I like you!
G-Geez, stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought.
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I have to be...
D-Don't think that just because we're sitting together, we're friends or anything...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that...
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, s-so don't get any ideas...
If you keep staring at me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
I didn't do it for you, I did it because I wanted to, g-got that?
Y-You're not allowed to touch me! Personal space, you know?
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, it's just a friendly gesture...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?

You're really annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you for now.
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even ask...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy...
I-I'll go to the movies with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it...
D-Don't get too excited, it's just a friendly gesture...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Do I look like I care about your opinion?
Baka! Stop smiling at me!
I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you...
Don't think this means I like you or anything...
T-This isn't a date, got it?
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I didn't save you because I l-like you, it was just a reflex...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You can't just w-walk away from me like that!
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't think that just because I'm sitting next to you, I'm interested!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's making me uncomfortable!
I only helped you because I didn't want to see you fail, not because I care!
T-This cake is... really good, but don't think I'm saying that because of you!
I'm only walking with you because it's on my way, g-got it?

I'm not going to hold your hand, so stop asking! It's embarrassing!
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I only did it because... because I felt like it, okay? Not for you!
I don't need your help, I can do it myself! Just... just leave me alone!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around!
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's really annoying...
I did it for myself, not for you, g-got it?
If you tell anyone I cooked for you, I'll d-deny it...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even notice...
I'm not being kind, I just didn't want to see you mess it up...
D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it...
It's not like I was worried about you or anything... just didn't want to be bothered with the hassle...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
Sh-Shut up and just accept it, okay? Don't make a big deal...
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
Y-You're really something else... always getting me to do things for you...
I'm only doing this because it's convenient for me, not because I care about you...
I-It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't think I'm going to start being all nice to you now!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I only helped you because... because I felt like it, okay?
T-This doesn't mean I owe you anything, got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
I'm only doing this because it needs to be done, not because of you!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you like that...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat, yeah...
You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I won't admit it, but... you're kind of... tolerable...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it!
D-Don't think this means I'm going to go easy on you, baka!
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're wrong!
It's not like I care about you or anything... but don't get hurt, okay?
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misinterpret me!
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone... not because I want to spend time with you!
D-Do you mind not looking at me? It's embarrassing...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but don't die or anything...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, but... here, take this
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think this means I owe you one or anything!

D-don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only doing this because I have to, g-got it?
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it!
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
T-tell me you didn't really think I was going to go out with you...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but... but why are you talking to her?
D-don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice because...
I-I swear, it's not like I'm looking out for you or anything...
Y-you really are an idiot, aren't you?
I'm not going to admit it, but... but you're not as bad as I thought...
G-guys like you are always so... so annoying!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
D-don't think you can just waltz in here and... and steal my heart or something!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-This isn't a date, okay? Don't get the wrong idea...
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I don't know why I'm even talking to you, you're so stupid...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're kind of... interesting...
D-Don't look at me like that! I'm not blushing!
I'm not going to hold your hand, so stop asking!
I-I guess you're not as bad as I thought... but don't expect me to say it again...
Baka! You're so clumsy, can't you even walk straight?
I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, got it?
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it!
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start going easy on you!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever or something...
Y-You're not allowed to talk to me like that, I'm the one who's always right!
I swear, I'm only doing this for myself, not for your benefit...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
T-Today was a one-time thing, don't expect me to be all nice to you from now on...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face?
I don't know what you're talking about, so d-don't ask me...
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything...
G-Geez, can't you see I'm busy? Leave me alone...
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm not interested...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not...
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty, g-got it?
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I don't need your help, so just back off...
I-It's not like I'm helping you because I like you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
T-This doesn't mean I owe you anything, got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because... uh, never mind!
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat, yeah!
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it, okay?
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I'm only going to this event with you because... I have nothing better to do...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I don't know why I'm helping you, but don't think it's because I like you...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, got it?
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of interesting...
Baka! Don't think you can win me over that easily...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess.
H-Hey, don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around!
I'm not being stubborn, I just have a different opinion, okay?
Y-You're really annoying, but... I'll tolerate you for now.
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, but... you're not as bad as I thought.
G-Geez, stop making me blush! It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
B-Baka! Don't touch me! I can walk on my own!
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right... there's a difference!
I-It's not like I'm helping you because I like you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just didn't want to see you fail...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I didn't do it for you, I did it for myself, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to help you here?
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
S-Stop looking at me with those eyes, it's distracting...
I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I guess...
Y-You'd better not tell anyone I said that, or I'll deny it...
I'm only being nice to you because it's convenient, don't read too much into it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I p-pity you...
D-Don't think that just because we're teammates, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
W-Why are you always so cheerful? Can't you just be grumpy for once?
I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is just... naturally red...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
S-Shut up and don't talk to me, okay?
If I'm going to the movies with you, it's just because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me... uncomfortable...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to help you study or anything...
I-I don't know why I'm saying this, but... be careful, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this for myself...
I-I don't need your help, but thanks anyway...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I'm not doing it for you, I'm doing it because I want to...
B-Baka! Don't touch me!
I-I'm not going to admit it, but you're kind of... tolerable...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm helping you out of the goodness of my heart...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me, I'm trying to concentrate!
I don't know what you're talking about, so just d-drop it already!
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy, it's not like I'm going to help you every time!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... just being polite, okay?!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's making me... uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I care about you or anything, but... but maybe you should be more careful...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny! I'm s-serious...
I'm only saying this because I have to, but... you should probably apologize to her...
I-I don't need your help, so just l-leave me alone!
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I'm going to start being all nice and friendly...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just don't want to be alone...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... uh, looking at the time...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
D-Don't think this means I'll go easy on you, okay?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
Stop teasing me! I'm not a kid anymore...
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm going to start being nice to you!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be standing here...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
It's not like I did it for you, I just didn't want to see you fail...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that! I'm not blushing!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, but... maybe I'll consider going to the festival with you...
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'll never admit it, but maybe I was a little worried about you...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm waiting for you or anything...
D-Don't think you can just waltz in here and expect me to be happy to see you!
Baka! I was just, uh, testing the temperature of the water, that's all...
I-If you must know, I only helped you because I felt sorry for you...
Y-You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't care!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, got it?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-It's not like I trust you or anything, but...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this!
W-What are you staring at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-If you want something, just ask already! Stop beating around the bush!
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not being kind, I'm just... tolerant of you.
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me when I'm talking!
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless.
I-I didn't do it for your sake, I did it because... because I felt like it!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable.
H-Hey, don't get the wrong idea, I'm only walking with you because it's on my way.
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat, yeah.
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Annoying, but... but...
I won't admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought you'd be.
G-Get your hands off me! I can do it myself!
I-I'm not going to thank you or anything, but... you're not completely terrible.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... you seem somewhat reliable...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
G-Good job, I suppose... but don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can start bossing me around...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything... I just don't want to see you fail...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'll have you know, I'm only participating in this group project because I have to...
S-Stop looking at me with those eyes! It's annoying...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to help you study or anything...
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... be careful, okay?
D-Don't think this means I trust you or anything... I just don't have a choice...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought you'd be...
B-Baka! Don't touch me! I can do it myself...
I-It's not like I'm blushing or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just don't want to lose...
Baka! You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I didn't do it for you, I just... happened to be going that way...
Y-You're really getting on my nerves, but... but I won't back down!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, it's just... circumstances...
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of... tolerable...
Baka! Don't touch me! I can handle it myself...
I didn't mean to say that, j-just forget it...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... being polite, that's all...
D-Don't look at me with those eyes, it's... it's embarrassing...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
T-This is not a date, it's just a study session... with pizza...
You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I-I didn't say I liked you or anything, so don't get your hopes up...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?...
I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to tease me...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you need it or anything...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't think that just because I'm helping you, I l-like you!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's really annoying!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I don't need your help, but... but since you're offering, I suppose it's okay...
D-Do you mind not looking at me like that? It's embarrassing...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just... just the heat, that's all...
If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I'm not going to fall for your tricks, so don't even try...
W-Why are you being so nice to me? It's suspicious...
I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
Y-You're not going to tell anyone about this, are you? I'll never hear the end of it...
I-I mean, I was just walking this way anyway...
D-Don't think I'm going easy on you just because you're cute!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, got it?
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm not interested!
I-I was just, uh, testing you to see if you're worthy...
G-Geez, don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice...
I'm not blushing! It's just, uh, the heat...
I-I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I guess...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm trying to be serious here...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't get the wrong idea!
If I'm going with you, it's just because I have nothing better to do...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I don't know why I bother with you, but just shut up and listen...
D-Do you really think I'm that interested in you? H-Hmph!
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
I-I mean, I was just trying to help... Not that I care about you or anything...
G-Get away from me! You're being too close!
Y-You really are something else... I don't know whether to be annoyed or impressed...
I-I didn't say I trusted you, so don't get too full of yourself!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess.
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... you seem kind of okay, I suppose.
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, that's all!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, but... maybe we can walk together, I mean, if you want to.
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off, it's creepy!
I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... I think you're kind of... interesting.
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, but... you're not as bad as I thought.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...

S-Stop looking at me like that, it's embarrassing...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but...
D-Don't tell anyone, but I think you might be okay...
I'll never forgive you if you tell anyone I said that...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I have to be...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I didn't save you because I like you or anything, I just didn't want to see you get hurt...
T-This doesn't mean I'm going to start going easy on you, okay?
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, s-so don't look at me...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're really annoying...
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks for asking, I guess...
D-Don't think this means I trust you or anything, I'm just... just being cautious...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...

I-If you must know, I was just... uh... testing the food...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you...
W-Why are you still here? Can't you see I'm trying to study?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I-I was just, uh, testing the cookies to make sure they're not poisonous...
Y-You really think I'd go out of my way to help you? Hmph!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's making me blush...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're invading my personal space...
I-If you must know, I was just trying to protect you from getting hurt...
B-Baka! Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm going to start going easy on you!
I-I swear, it's not like I'm interested in you or anything... I just don't want to see you get hurt, that's all...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Always getting into trouble...
I-I'm not going to forgive you that easily, so don't expect any special treatment from me!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-That's not a gift, I just didn't want it anymore...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's distracting...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'd never admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought...
G-Geez, stop looking at me like that! It's making me blush...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being nice...
B-Baka! You're so clumsy, can't you even walk straight?
I-I didn't mean to, but... you look kind of cute when you're sleeping...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I-I swear, I'm only doing this for myself, not for you...
D-Don't even think about touching me, you idiot!
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...
G-Geez, can't you just leave me alone for once?
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't get any ideas...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I-I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I guess...
D-Don't think this means I trust you or anything, b-because I don't...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pity you...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, got it?
Y-You're so clumsy, I swear... Fine, let me help.
Dont look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-I don't know why I bother with you...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not in the mood...
If you think I'm doing this out of kindness, you're wrong...
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
It's not like I'm worried about you or anything... Just be careful, okay?
Gah, don't get the wrong idea! I just don't want to see you get hurt...
I'm only saying this because I have to, not because I want to...
D-Don't expect me to always be there for you, got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face?
I don't care about your opinion, but... maybe you're not completely wrong...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me! I'm not blushing...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's distracting...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, but... be careful on the stairs...
G-Geez, don't make such a big deal out of it... it was just a small gift...
I-I didn't mean to worry you, it's just that... I care about you, okay?
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easy to provoke...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be going the same way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, so don't get your hopes up...
H-Hey, don't touch me! Personal space, you know?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I was just, uh, making sure you didn't get lost, that's all...
G-Geez, stop staring at me! You're making me nervous...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Annoying, but... but...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
D-Don't think you can win me over with just a few nice words, baka!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!

If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
I'm not laughing, I'm just... just coughing, yeah...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
G-Good job, I suppose... but don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I'm not blushing! It's just... just the heat, okay?
D-Don't look at me like that! I'm not interested in you...
I-I mean, I'm only helping you because I have to...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, got it?
T-This is just a one-time thing, so don't expect it again...
If you tell anyone I did this, I'll deny it...
I-I'm not being kind, I'm just being... efficient...
St-Stop looking at me like that, it's creepy!
I don't need your thanks, just don't bother me...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm still mad at you...
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because I lost a bet...
Y-You're not going to go and tell everyone I'm soft, are you?
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Why are you looking at me? It's not like I'm interesting or anything...

D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
It's not like I care about your opinion, but... maybe you're not completely wrong...
I'm not being stubborn, I just know what's best!
W-Why do you always have to be so nice to me? It's annoying!
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
Baka! Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm going to start going easy on you...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
B-Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I like you or something...
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, g-got it?
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get the wrong idea!
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
I didn't say I was going to protect you, I just...just happened to be there, okay?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
It's not like I care about your feelings or anything, but...but maybe you should be more careful...
I'm not blushing! It's just...just the heat, that's all...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I didn't mean to save you, it just...just sort of happened, okay?
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not going to fall for it...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...

Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I don't need your help, I can do it myself! B-But thanks for offering, I guess...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun... in the middle of winter...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you need it or anything...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, d-don't be ridiculous!
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Always getting on my nerves...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
T-This present is not from me, I just happened to find it on the ground... with your name on it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
T-That's not a compliment, it's just a fact...
I won't admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll...
I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm only sitting next to you because the other seats are taken...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Why are you always so clumsy?
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine, so don't get the wrong idea!
T-Turn around! I need to... uh, adjust my sock.
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless.
I-I won't admit it, but... you're kind of... tolerable.
G-Give me back my book! I wasn't done reading it!
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, not because I enjoy your company!
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's embarrassing!
I-I'm not angry, I'm just... passionately expressing myself.
Y-You're really good at getting on my nerves, you know that?
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, but... maybe we can walk together.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything! Got it?
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?!
It's not like I care about your opinions, but... maybe you're right this time...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but... I suppose you're not all bad...
I didn't do it for your sake, I did it because... I felt like it, okay?!
If you think I'm going to go easy on you just because you're cute, you're wrong...
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
D-Don't think this means I trust you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
If I'm going to the movies with you, it's just because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're invading my p-personal space...
It's not like I'm blushing or anything... I just have a fever, that's all...
I-I don't know why you're making such a big deal about this, it's not like it's a date or anything...
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to be all cheerful about it...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right... there's a difference...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks for offering, I guess...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty as a friend, not because I actually like you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
G-Good luck on your test, not that you need it or anything...
I'm only walking with you because it's on my way, d-don't read too much into it...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
If I'm going with you, it's just because I don't want you to get lost...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're invading my p-personal space...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You think I'm cute? D-Don't be ridiculous!
I didn't say I liked your gift, I just said it was... acceptable...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not going to fall for it...
If you think I'm going to hold your hand, you're sadly mistaken...
G-Geez, don't be so loud! You're going to wake up the whole neighborhood...
I'm only being nice to you because I feel like it, so don't get used to it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? I'm not interested in you!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, but... you're not as bad as I thought.
I-I swear, I'm not blushing! It's just the heat!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of nice, I guess.
S-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I had fun today...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
G-Geez, stop teasing me! I'm trying to be serious here...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because I want to, g-got it?
W-Why do you always have to be so loud? Can't you just be quiet for once?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
D-Do I really have to explain why I'm blushing? Just drop it!
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything... but thanks, I guess...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that! You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right... there's a difference!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I didn't say I liked you or anything... I just said you're not as annoying as I thought...
B-Baka! Don't touch me! Personal space, you know?
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it...
I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even notice my feelings...
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? Just leave me alone...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, so don't stare at me...
I didn't say I liked you, so stop misunderstanding me...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for your sake...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to go easy on you, got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I suppose it's not like I have anything better to do... than to help you...
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a casual meeting...
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I actually liked that movie...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get excited...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's distracting...
I-I didn't mean to blush, it's just the heat, that's all...
If you think I'm doing this because I like you, you're sadly mistaken...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're not going to start teasing me now, are you?...
It's not like my heart skipped a beat when you smiled or anything...
I'll have you know, I'm only being nice to you because I feel sorry for you...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Why are you smiling at me?
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
If you tell anyone I saved you, I'll d-deny it!
You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I did it for myself, not for you, so don't get the wrong idea!
Stop looking at me like that, it's c-creepy!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
Sh-shut up and don't talk to me, okay?
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-I won't forgive you if you tease me about this...
D-Do you really think I'm that kind of person?!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... tolerable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all cocky!
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I'd never admit it out loud, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to be mean to you?
I-I don't know why I'm always getting stuck with you, but it's really frustrating...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
If you think I'm being nice to you, you're wrong!
T-This is just a one-time thing, don't expect it again!
I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even notice my... uh, never mind...
I swear, I'm only yelling at you because you're so stupid!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just trying to help...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat!
If you tell anyone I did this, I'll deny it!
I'm only going with you because I have nothing better to do...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Don't think I'm saving you a seat just because I like you!
D-Do you really think I care about your opinion?
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I don't know why I bother with you, but d-don't get too comfortable!
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... but I'll give you a chance...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I-I didn't do it for you, I swear! It was just a coincidence...
Baka! You're so clumsy, I had to help you or you'd get hurt!
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I think you're sort of... interesting...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, so don't even think about it...
Sh-Shut up and just eat your food, don't talk to me...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
D-Drop it, I'm not going to tell you my favorite food, so just forget it...
You're really d-dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's upset...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't look at me...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even ask...
T-This present is just something I found lying around, don't think it means anything...
I-I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to talk during the film...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!

Y-You're really clumsy, aren't you? Someone has to take care of you...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I didn't say I wanted to be your partner, but I suppose it's better than being alone...
T-This is a one-time thing, so don't expect me to always help you out...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Always getting into trouble...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you now...

I wasn't trying to protect you, I just... didn't want to see you get hurt...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but... who's that girl you're talking to?
Baka! Don't think that just because I'm helping you, I'm going to go easy on you...

It's not like I care about you, but... be careful, okay?
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? I can feel your breath...
I-I'm not jealous or anything, but who's that person you're talking to?
T-This is not a date, no matter what you think!
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I like your company...

T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
D-Do you mind not sitting next to me? I need some... personal space...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, ggot it?

I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That doesn't mean I like spending time with you, got it?
H-Hey, don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I-I'm not jealous or anything, but who's that person you're talking to?
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-I was just, uh, testing your reflexes, that's all...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's making me nervous...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
B-Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and... and...
I-I'll never forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite.
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it.
Y-You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless.
D-Do I really have to explain why I'm doing this? Just accept it!
I'm not jealous, I'm just... concerned. Yeah, that's it.
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it, okay?
If you say one more thing, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I'm only going with you because I don't want to be alone, not because I want to be with you.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't make this cake for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
T-This isn't a date, it's just a... a study group...
Y-You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't think that just because I smiled, I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-I was just, uh, testing my cooking skills... and you just happened to be here...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?...
I didn't say I liked you or anything, I just... appreciate your efforts...
G-Get away from me, you're making me blush...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just... explaining why I'm right...
Baka! Don't touch me, I can take care of myself...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even notice my feelings...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't get any ideas...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's distracting...
I-I didn't say I wanted to be your friend, so don't get too excited...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? So clueless...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I-I mean, I was just walking by and saw you struggling, that's all...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping because I have to!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you must know, I was thinking about... uh, something else...
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a study session...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only eating with you because the cafeteria is closed...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's...
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm not interested!
I-I swear, it's not like I'm looking out for you or anything...
G-Geez, don't make such a big deal out of it, okay?
I-If I help you, don't think it means I like you or anything...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat, yeah...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be going the same way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway... not that I'm doing it for you!
W-What's it to you if I'm wearing my hair down today?
D-Do you really think I care about your opinion? Hmph!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you or anything...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat, yeah...
Baka! You're so clumsy, can't you even walk straight?
I wasn't trying to protect you, I just... didn't want to see you get hurt, okay?
T-Today's weather is nice, but don't expect me to say it's because of you...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? Stop it, it's creepy!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't think that just because I'm sitting next to you, I'm interested!
T-This cake is... really good, okay? Don't read into it!
H-Hey, stop staring at me! I'm trying to study...
I only helped you because I didn't want to see you fail, g-got it?
Y-You're really annoying, but... but don't get hurt, okay?
I'm not blushing! It's just... the temperature in here...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? P-personal space, you know?
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you!
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easily embarrassed...
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Baka!
I'm not doing this for you, I'm doing it because... because I have to, okay?
G-Geez, don't look so happy just because I smiled at you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
H-Hey, don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be standing here!
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
You're really annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
G-Good job, I suppose... but don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I'm only doing this because it needs to be done, not because I care about you...

I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever or something...
Y-You're not going to tell anyone about this, are you?...
I-I mean, it's not like I care about you or anything, but...
G-Good luck on your test, not that I'm rooting for you or anything...
I'm only giving you this gift because I didn't want it anymore, g-got it?
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice, I've forgiven you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Do I look like I'm interested in your stupid hobbies?
Baka! Don't touch me, I can handle it myself!
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, ggot it?

I don't know what you're talking about, s-so stop asking me...
It's not like I care about you or anything, but... be careful, okay?
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, s-so don't look at me like that...
Y-You're really annoying, but... I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, n-not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not going to fall for it...
I-I didn't do it for you, I swear! I just... happened to have some extra time...

I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?

You're so... so... ugh, I don't even know what to say to you!
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
T-That's not a gift, it's just something I found on the ground...

I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...

I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't twist my words!
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks, I guess...
H-Hey, don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
D-Do you mind not looking at me like that? It's embarrassing...
I didn't say I liked it, I just said it was... tolerable...
S-Shut up and don't talk about that in front of others!
I'm not being quiet, I'm just... conserving my energy...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I don't need your help, but... thanks for offering, I suppose...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I did it for myself, not for you, so don't get the wrong idea!
T-This is a one-time thing, don't expect me to always save you!
You're really d-dense, aren't you? Can't even notice my f-feelings!
I'm not being kind, I just didn't want to see you f-fail, okay?
D-Don't look at me like that! I-I'm not blushing!
If you tell anyone I helped you, I'll d-deney it!
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care!
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that e-easy!
I don't need your h-help, but... but thanks, I guess...
You're so clueless, it's almost... almost cute...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is not for you, I just baked it for... for myself...
D-Do I really have to sit next to you on the train?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll get angry!
G-Good luck on your test, not that you need it or anything...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being friendly...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Stop looking at me! You're making me blush...
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because I wanted to!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
G-Geez, don't touch me like that! Personal space, you know?
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
D-Don't even think about trying to hold my hand!
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you mess it up!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice...
Baka! You're so clueless, it's annoying...
I-If you must know, I was worried about you... not that I care or anything...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Stop staring at me! You're making me uncomfortable...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because I want to...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice, I've gone soft...
I-I'm only saying this because I have to, not because I want to...
Baka! Don't make me repeat myself!
I-If you don't stop teasing me, I'll... I'll...
I'm not blushing! It's just my face is a little... hot, that's all...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I didn't buy this cake for you, I just happened to have extra...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll...I'll...
I didn't say I was going to sit with you at lunch, I just sat down here because...
S-Stop calling me cute, it's embarrassing!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
Y-You're not funny, so stop trying to be...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, don't be ridiculous!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face?
It's not like I trust you or anything, I just... uh... need your help...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
W-Why are you being so nice to me? It's creepy...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even notice my feelings...
D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it...
I-I swear, I'm only being nice to you because I have to...
G-Geez, don't look at me like that! It's embarrassing...
I-If you think I'm doing this because I care about you, you're wrong...
S-Shut up and don't say anything, or I'll...I'll...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just leave me alone...
Y-You're so annoying, but...but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not going to go easy on you just because...
I-I'm only saying this because I have to, but...you're not completely useless...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because... because I want to!
T-That's not what I meant! Just forget it!
If you think I'm doing this out of the goodness of my heart, you're wrong!
I-I swear, I'm only yelling at you because you're so annoying!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not going easy on you or anything!
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought.
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is terrible, but I'll eat it anyway...
Dumb boy, can't even take care of himself...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's creepy...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'm not going to forgive you that easily, baka!
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this for your sake!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm being nice to you, you're wrong!
T-That's not what I meant! Don't twist my words!
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't expect it!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm not interested!
I-I was just... concerned about you, that's all. Don't read too much into it!
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's making me uncomfortable!
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, not because I enjoy your company!
Y-You're not going to tell anyone about this, are you? I'll deny it if you do!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so don't ask me!
D-Don't think that just because we're talking, I've forgiven you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I'd never admit it out loud, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
S-Shut up and don't look at me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I'm only saying this because I have to, but... thanks for your help...
G-Geez, stop making me repeat myself! I already said I'd go with you...
I-If you tell anyone I said this, I'll deny it... but you're kind of nice, I guess...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it!
If I'm going with you, it's just because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you now...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's being nice...
I'm s-sorry, okay? But don't expect me to say it again...
It's not like I was worried about you or anything, I just didn't want to have to deal with the fallout...
Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I mean, if you want to walk with me, I won't stop you or anything...
D-Don't get too close, I don't want to catch your stupidity...]
I-I mean, I was just walking this way anyway...
D-Don't think I'm helping you out of the goodness of my heart!
H-Hey, stop staring! It's not like I'm blushing or anything...
Baka! You're so clumsy, I swear...
I-If you must know, I only shared my lunch with you because I didn't want it to go to waste...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
W-What are you looking at? My face? H-Hey, stop it!
I-I'm only going to the festival with you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm only being nice because...
G-Geez, don't get the wrong idea or anything... I just didn't want you to get hurt, okay?
I-It's not like I trust you or anything, b-but... just be careful, alright?
H-Hmph! You think I'm worried about you? D-Don't be ridiculous!
I-I guess you're not as bad as I thought... but don't expect me to start going easy on you or anything...
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? W-Wipe it off, it's annoying!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I won't forgive you if you tell anyone I helped you...
T-This is a one-time thing, don't expect me to do it again...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
D-Don't get too close, I don't want to catch your germs...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it!
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, got it?
I-I'm just saying this because I have to, not because I want to...
I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of... tolerable...
S-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I had fun today...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
D-Don't get too full of yourself, I'm only being nice because I have to...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat... yeah, that's it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I-I didn't make this bento for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
T-Too bad for you, but I'm not going to lend you my notes...
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being nice...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
S-Stop following me! I can take care of myself...
I-It's not like I care about what you think, but... but just be careful, okay?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I-I didn't mean to trip and fall into your arms, it was an accident...
D-Don't get any ideas, but... but I might have had a little fun today...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be going in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway... not that I'm doing it for you...
Sh-Shut up and let me concentrate on my studying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything, but... maybe you're not as stupid as I thought...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun...
G-Good job on winning that game, but don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I wasn't looking at you, I was just... gazing off into space...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to try anything funny...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
If I'm going to the movies with you, it's only because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop staring at me!
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but why are you talking to her?
G-Geez, don't be so loud! You're going to wake up the whole neighborhood...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
I-I mean, if you want to walk me home, I won't stop you or anything...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
If you think I'm going to hold your hand, you've got another thing coming...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What's with the staring? Can't you see I'm busy?
If I'm going to the movies with you, it's just because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Do you mind not standing so close? You're making me uncomfortable...
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything, but... maybe you should wear something else...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy! You're going to hurt someone...
I'm only baking cookies for the class because I have to, not because I want to make you happy...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? Stop it, it's creepy...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but if you insist, I suppose you can assist me...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I don't know why I'm always getting stuck with you...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's embarrassing!
F-Fine, I'll go to the movies with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite...
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice, I've forgiven you...
I-I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, that's all...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smilling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? I'm not blushing!
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's distracting...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... maybe you're not so bad...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
G-Get away from me, you're being too friendly!
I-I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty, that's all...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, it's just a favor...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I only helped you because I felt sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I just... uh... borrowed this book...
I-I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I didn't mean to save you, it just... just happened, okay?
G-Geez, stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, not because I want to spend time with you...
I-I'll never admit it, but... but you're not as annoying as I thought...
D-Do you mind not looking at me like that? It's making me nervous...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're sorely mistaken!
It's not like I care about you or anything... but don't die, okay?
S-Shut up and don't look at me! I'm not blushing!
I-I was just... uh, just testing your reflexes, that's all...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I-If you want to live, then don't make me angry...
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I-I don't know what you're talking about! I'm not being nice to you!
B-Baka! Don't think that just because I saved you, I like you or something!
It's not like... I mean, I just didn't want to see you get hurt, that's all...
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because it's my duty... not because I care about you!
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping you because...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I-If you must know, I was just... um, testing the food...
It's not like I care about you, but... be careful, okay?
T-That's not what I meant! Don't twist my words!
I'm not doing it for your sake, g-got it?
D-Do I really need to explain why I'm mad at you?
I-I won't forgive you, even if you apologize a million times!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I-I'm only going with you because... I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I've forgiven you, because I haven't!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? I'm not blushing or anything...
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I pity you, okay?
I don't know why I'm saying this, but... y-you should be more careful...
D-Do you really think I'd go on a date with someone like you? Hah!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, but... here, have a cookie...
I-I swear, I'm only doing this for myself, not for your benefit!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
G-Good luck with your thing... not that I care or anything...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right... and you're wrong, baka!

Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-This is just a one-time thing, don't expect it again!
I'm only being nice because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you!
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because it's my duty...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of... interesting...
S-Stop smiling at me, it's creepy!
I-I'll never admit it, but... I had fun with you today...
D-Don't tell anyone, but... I might actually like your cooking...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I owe you something!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I-If you must know, I only did it because I felt like it...
T-That doesn't mean I'm going to start doing favors for you all the time!
I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
G-Geez, don't get the wrong idea, I'm only walking with you because...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?!
D-Do you mind not looking at me? It's making me uncomfortable...

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
D-Don't get too close, personal space!
I'm only teasing you because you're so gullible...
B-Baka, don't make me hurt you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I p-pity you...
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it...
I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so... annoying...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's being nice...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever or something...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even ask...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're really weird...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like spending time with you...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me! I'm not blushing!
I-I swear, it's not like I'm looking out for you or anything...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
G-Geez, stop making me repeat myself! I'm not your servant!
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
T-This is the last time I'm helping you, so don't expect anything more from me!
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought you'd be...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
If I'm going to the movies with you, it's just because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
It's not like I care about you or anything, but maybe you should try wearing a different shirt...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only teasing you because I like to see you get flustered, okay?
G-Geez, stop making such a big deal out of everything...
I didn't do it for you, I swear! I just happened to make your favorite dessert...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy...
If I'm going with you, it's just because I have nothing better to do...
D-Do I really have to say it? I'm only doing this for myself...
I-I didn't mean to save you, it just sort of... happened...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's being nice...
I'm not being kind, I just don't want to see you mess things up...
G-Good luck with that, not that you'll need it or anything...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
D-Don't think this means I trust you or anything, baka...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it till the end of time...
I-It's not like I'm saying this because I care or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, okay?
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I did it because I felt like it, not for your sake...
T-That's not what I meant, so stop misunderstanding!
If I'm helping you, it's only because I have nothing better to do...
D-Do you really think I'd go out of my way for someone like you?
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, got it?
Don't think that just because I'm being nice, I've gone soft...
I-I won't admit it, but maybe, just maybe, I had a little fun...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
It's not like my heart skipped a beat when I saw you, so don't flatter yourself...
I'll never say it out loud, but... you're kind of... tolerable...
If you think I'm doing all this for your benefit, you're sadly mistaken...
I-I'm not looking at you, I'm just... gazing in your general direction...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping you because...
I'm not doing this for your sake, g-got it?
Sh-shut up and don't look at me like that!
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to...
I-I don't care about your opinion, but...
T-That doesn't mean I like you or anything, okay?
Geez, stop teasing me! I'm not that easy...
I'm only saying this because I have to, not because...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I'll never admit it, but... maybe I do...
Baka, don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study!
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, it was just a reflex...
S-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I think your cooking is actually pretty good...
I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?
If I'm being nice to you, it's not because I like you, it's because I p-pity you...
I didn't mean to smile when I saw you, it was just a muscle spasm...
Y-You're not allowed to talk to me during lunch, I'm trying to eat in peace...
I'm not going to hold your hand, even if it is cold outside, d-don't be ridiculous...
I only yelled at you because you're being stupid, not because I care about you...
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to be all smiles if you fail...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-That's not a gift, it's just something I didn't need anymore...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're even more annoying than I thought...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
T-That's not a compliment, it's just a fact...
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, not because I enjoy your company...
If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I've gone soft!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... being polite.
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to be kind.
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
I'm only doing this for myself, not for your sake!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you!
I-I swear, if you tell anyone I did this, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
Y-You're so frustrating, but... but I suppose you're not all bad.
I-I don't know why I'm even bothering with you, but... just be careful, okay?
Baka! Don't look at me like that, it's making me blush!
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of... interesting.
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start going easy on you, got it?
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm not going to apologize, even if it was my fault...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misunderstand!
I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
It's not like I'm worried about you, I just... uh, never mind...
D-Don't get too close, personal space!
I'm only being nice to you because it's polite, that's all...
You're so stupid, why can't you just understand?!
I-I didn't say I liked your gift, I just said it was... nice...
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll get angry!
I'm not blush-ing, it's just the heat...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
If I'm with you, it's not because I want to be, got it?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you?
I'm only being nice to you because you're pitiful...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being friendly...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me!
G-Geez, don't touch me! Personal space, you know?
I swear, I'm only doing this for myself, not for you...
Y-You're not going to misunderstand, are you?
I-I mean, it's not like I'm waiting for you or anything...
Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I-I'm not going to go easy on you just because you're cute...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite.
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-This is just a coincidence, don't read into it!
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
Y-You're not even worth getting angry at!
I'm only saying this because it needs to be said, not because I care...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not going easy on you!
I-I swear, it's not like I'm looking out for you or anything...
If you think you can just waltz in here and... and... ugh, never mind!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat.
Y-You'd better not tell anyone I did this, or... or...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it...
If I'm going with you, it's just because I have nothing better to do...
D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it...
I-I didn't say I liked you, so stop thinking that...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite...
I-I was just trying to help, not that I care about you or anything...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's embarrassing...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
J-Just don't expect me to always be there for you, got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a good person, not because I like you...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem I wrote for class...
Why are you looking at me? I-I'm not doing anything!
I don't need your help, I can do it myself, b-but thanks for offering...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're being really annoying...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever or something...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're... you're really weird...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
Y-You're not going to tell anyone that I secretly like romantic comedies, are you?
I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not being tsundere at all...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Do I look like I care about your opinion?
Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I'm only helping you because I have to, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because...
D-Dont get the wrong idea, I just happened to...
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're...
I won't say it, so don't even think about asking me to...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
G-Geez, don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing...
I'm doing this for myself, not for you, so...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you?
I'm not going to admit it, but maybe, just maybe...
D-Don't tell anyone, but I might actually...
I-I'll never forgive you if you tell anyone I...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't make this bento for you, I just... had extra food...
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a... a study group...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but don't get hurt, okay?
I'm only helping you because... because I don't want to see you fail...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? I can feel your... breath...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
I didn't say I liked you, I just... said you're not as bad as I thought...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not... funny...
I'm not going to hold your hand, but... but be careful on the stairs...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?...
I-I'll go with you to the movies, but... don't expect me to enjoy it...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you...

D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... you seem kind of okay, I suppose.
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
Sh-shut up and don't tease me about my hair, it's none of your business!
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
W-Why are you being so nice to me? It's kind of... unsettling.
G-Good luck on your exam, not that you need it or anything...

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!

Why are you looking at me like that? It's making me uncomfortable...
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks for noticing me, I guess.
D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it...
If you must know, I was just... just testing your reflexes, that's all.
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even ask!
T-Today was... tolerable, I suppose. Don't expect me to say that again, though.
I-If you want to be friends, then... then I won't stop you, I guess.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I suppose it's not like I have anything better to do... than to help you...
T-That doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not blushing...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's distracting...
I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to embarrass me...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only helping you because it's my duty as a classmate, not because I like you...
S-Stop smiling at me like that, it's creepy...

G-Geez, don't be so clumsy! Can't you even walk properly?
I-If you think I'm doing this because I like you, you're sadly mistaken...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'm only saying this because I have to, but... you're not completely useless...
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice to you, it means I've gone soft...

Baka! Stop teasing me, it's not funny!

I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Always getting into trouble...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
I-I guess you're not as stupid as you look...
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I like you or anything...
Baka! Stop teasing me! I'm trying to be serious here...
I-if you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I owe you something!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-If you must know, I only did it because I felt like it...
T-That doesn't mean I'm going to start being nice to you all the time!
I swear, it's not like I'm going soft on you or anything...
D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it...
Y-You're really annoying, you know that?
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care...
G-Get away from me, you're making me uncomfortable!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just leave me alone...
D-Don't think you can just waltz in here and expect me to be all friendly...
I-I'll never admit it, but... maybe I did it for you, just a little bit...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This is not a date, it's just a study session...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not blushing...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it...
I-If I'm going with you, it's just because I don't want to be alone...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, it's just... uh, convenience...
I-I swear, I'm only doing this for myself, not for you...
B-Baka! Don't touch me like that, it's too... familiar...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
You're so annoying, but... but I'll help you with your homework...
I'm not doing this for you, I'm doing it for myself, g-got it?
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's making me... uncomfortable...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself, b-but thanks for offering...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that, it's making me blush...
I wasn't trying to impress you, I just... happened to wear my best dress today...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm only going to the movies with you because... because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
G-Geez, don't get the wrong idea, okay?
If I'm being kind to you, it's only because... uh, never mind...
I don't know why I bother with you, you're so... so... ugh!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I'm only eating with you because I'm starving, not because I want to...
It's not like I'm waiting for you or anything, I just... happened to be here...
Geh, don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop teasing me, it's not f-funny!
If I'm helping you, it's only because I p-pity you...
I don't know what you're talking about, so d-don't ask me...
You're so annoying, but I g-guess you're not all bad...
T-Turn around! Don't look at me when I'm changing!
I'm only eating with you because I'm s-starving, not because I like your company...
D-Do you mind? Some of us are trying to study here...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... uh, admiring the view...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not...
If you keep bothering me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I don't need your help, I can do it myself, so j-just leave me alone...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? Stop it, it's creepy...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
T-This is not a date, it's just a study session... with food... and games...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand, even if it is dark outside...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
W-Why are you being so nice to me? It's creepy...
I'm only being nice to you because I feel bad for you, not because I like you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Don't think I'm helping you out of the goodness of my heart!
W-why are you looking at me like that? It's embarrassing...
I don't need your protection, g-got it?
D-don't get the wrong idea, I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry...
You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I-I won't say thank you or anything, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
H-hey, don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-you really are something else, aren't you? Always getting into trouble...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
D-don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you or anything...
W-what's with that stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I-it's not like I care about you or anything, b-but... be careful, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy...
I don't care about your opinions, but... but yours is kind of... interesting...
D-Do I really have to say it? F-Fine, I'll go to the movies with you...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... but you seem kind of reliable...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that! I'm not blushing...
I-I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm just... just doing it because I want to...
Y-You're really stubborn, you know that? But... but I guess it's kind of cute...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? I was just, uh, looking at the sky...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
S-Shut up and don't talk to me, okay?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask!
D-Do you really think I'm that kind of person?!
I-I mean, if you want to walk with me, I won't stop you...
B-Baka! Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want!
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of nice, I guess...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
T-This doesn't mean I trust you, okay?
If you tell anyone I did this, I'll d-deny it!
I'm only being nice to you because it's convenient...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I-I swear, I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
You're really something else, aren't you? A-Annoying!
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
G-Good job, I suppose... but don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because I wanted to, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means we're friends now or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
If I'm blushing, it's just because I'm angry, okay?
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... I'll let you walk me home...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even think about it!
Y-You're really annoying, but... I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only teasing you because I like seeing you get flustered, g-got it?
I don't care about your opinion, but... thanks for noticing my new hair clip...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around!
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
I-I mean, I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this for your sake!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm being nice to you, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, not because I enjoy your company!
D-Do you mind? Personal space, please!
I-I didn't say I was going to protect you, I just... happened to be there!
Y-You're so awkward, can't you just leave me alone?
I-I swear, I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat!
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I-If you think you can win me over with those puppy eyes, think again!
Baka! Don't make me repeat myself!
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I-If you think I'm doing this because I care about you, you're wrong...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I don't know why I bother with you, but just don't expect me to always be there...
Y-You're so stupid, but somehow you manage to make me laugh...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'll never say it out loud, but... maybe I do have feelings for you...
D-Don't get any ideas, but I might actually be starting to enjoy your company...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop making me repeat myself!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... tolerant.
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong...
T-This doesn't mean I trust you, got it?
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you!
I-I swear, I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad.
I-I'm not going to forgive you that easily, so don't expect it!
J-Just because I'm talking to you doesn't mean we're friends...
I-I don't know why I'm even bothering with you...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-This is just a favor, don't get the wrong idea...
I don't care about your opinion, but... thanks, I guess...
Stop teasing me! I'm not that easy to provoke...
I-I mean, it's not like I was waiting for you or anything...
D-Don't get too close, personal space, you know?
You're really annoying, but... I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only being nice to you because I feel sorry for you...
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because... I wanted to, okay?!
Baka! Don't look at me with those eyes!

If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because I have no choice!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, that's all!
Y-You're so annoying, but I'll help you anyway...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems!
J-Just don't expect me to go easy on you, okay?
I'm not being kind, I'm just... being merciful.
D-Don't think you can take advantage of me, I'm not that weak!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-Turn around, I need to talk to you about something... but don't think this means I like you!
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're even more stupid than I thought!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
I-I didn't make this bento for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
Y-You really are dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to be nice...
I-I'm not going to apologize, you're the one who should be sorry!
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only sitting next to you because the other seats are taken, okay?
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...

D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because I want to!

It's not like I'm happy to see you, I just didn't want to be alone...
S-Shut up and don't talk to me, okay?
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice to you because...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of interesting, I guess...
G-Geez, stop making me feel so flustered!
I-I swear, I'm only looking out for you because you're so clueless...
Y-You'd better not tell anyone I said that, or I'll deny it!
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I suppose...
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!

I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't look at me!
You're really d-dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... t-tolerant...
G-Geez, don't get so excited, it's just a small gift...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
Baka! Don't touch me, I can take care of myself!
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice to you this one time...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Stop staring at me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I didn't do it for you, I swear! I just... happened to be in the area...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start going easy on you!
I-I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
S-Shut up and don't look at me! I'm trying to hide my face...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it!
T-This is just between you and me, okay? Don't go spreading it around...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-don't think this means I like you, g-got it?
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to...
T-today was a total disaster, and it's all your fault!
I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
W-why are you looking at me like that? Stop it!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah...
D-don't touch me! Personal space, you know?
I-I swear, I'm not crying, it's just allergies...
Y-you think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not!
I'm only going to the festival with you because... because I have nothing better to do...
S-stop teasing me! I'm not that weak!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
I-I mean, I was just walking by and saw you struggling, s-so I decided to help...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Why are you making me do all the work?
I-If you must know, I only shared my lunch with you because I didn't want it to go to waste...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
Y-You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I didn't say I believed you, I just... didn't say I didn't believe you...
W-Why are you smiling at me? It's creepy...
I'm only helping you because it's my duty as a... a friend, yeah...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-If I had known you were going to be so clumsy, I wouldn't have agreed to work with you...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, but... you're not as bad as I thought you'd be...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice, I've gone soft!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I-If you must know, I was just... concerned about you, okay?
T-That's not the point! The point is, you're being really annoying!
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it, okay?
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm not being tsundere, I'm just... passionately expressing myself!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only spending time with you because it's convenient!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
Y-You're so dense, it's infuriating! Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-I'm not jealous, I'm just... worried about you, in a completely platonic way!
S-Stop making me blush! It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything!
I-If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're... you're really weird!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-if you must know, I was just... uh, testing the coffee machine...
Y-You really are clueless, aren't you?
I won't go to the movies with you! Not that I was invited or anything...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it...
I-I mean, it's not like I care about your opinion or anything...
G-Get your own snack, I'm not buying one for you!
Y-You're really dense, you know that?
I-I was just, uh, trying to... protect you. Yeah, that's it...
I-If you value your life, don't mention this to anyone...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll get angry!
It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything, got it?
Y-You're so clueless, it's frustrating!
I'm only doing this for myself, not for your sake!
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice, I've forgiven you!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop asking me!
G-Get away from me, personal space!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just...just the heat!
Y-You're really something else, you know that?

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess.
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, okay?
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I-I don't know why I'm even talking to you, you're so... so... ugh!
D-Don't look at me like that, it's creepy!

T-This doesn't mean I trust you, it just means I have no choice...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to help?
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice because...
I-I don't need your thanks, just don't expect me to do it again!
G-Geez, stop bothering me, can't you see I'm busy?
I'm only going along with this because it's convenient, not because I want to...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... maybe I do like spending time with you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
T-This cake is... um, really good, I guess...

D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm only going to the movies with you because there's no one else to go with...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
Baka! Stop making me laugh, it's annoying!
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I like you or something...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, not because I want to...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Do I really have to say it? Fine... thanks for saving me...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?!
Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
W-Why are you looking at me like that? Stop it!
I'm only doing this for your own good, not because I care about you...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, but... you're kind of interesting...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Why are you always so clumsy?
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
T-Those cookies? I baked them for myself, not for you!
H-Hey, don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not blushing...
D-Do you mind not staring at me? It's embarrassing...
I-If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I didn't say I liked you or anything, so don't get any ideas...
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I-I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I'd never admit it out loud, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
G-Good job, I guess... but don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I don't know why I'm helping you, baka!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
T-This is just a one-time favor, got it?
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-If you tell anyone I did this, I'll deny it...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of okay, I guess...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'm only being nice to you because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not going to start being all sweet and stuff...
Y-You're really getting on my nerves, but... I'll help you this one time...
I-It's not like I'm helping you because I like you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this out of obligation!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's really annoying!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah!
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I feel sorry for you!
T-That's not what I meant! Don't twist my words!
I don't care about your opinion, but... maybe, just maybe, you're not completely wrong...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable!
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right!
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but... why are you talking to her?
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I wanted to, okay?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then... then you're even more annoying than I thought!
I'm not going to thank you or anything, but... you're not as useless as I thought you'd be
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a good person, okay?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so... frustrating!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I'm not jealous or anything, but why are you talking to her?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help you?
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because... because I want to, okay?
G-Geez, stop staring at me! Can't you see I'm busy?
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
D-Do you really think I'm that kind of person? I'm not that weak...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Don't think I'm smiling because of you!
Sh-Shut up and don't get too close!
I'm only helping you because I have to, g-got it?
D-Don't misunderstand, I'm not being nice to you!
You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I won't admit it, but your cooking is... tolerable...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, but... here, have a cookie...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right! Gah!
Y-You're really getting on my nerves, but... I'll go to the movies with you...
I-I'm only doing this for myself, not for you! Don't get any ideas!
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me... uncomfortable...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
B-Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and... and...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of... interesting...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
T-That's not a compliment, it's just a fact... you're not that bad, I guess...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not the worst person I've met...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you or anything...
G-Good job, I suppose... but don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... just be careful, okay?
D-Don't tell anyone, but I might have had a little fun today...
I-I'm not going to forgive you that easily, so don't get your hopes up...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
T-This isn't a date, okay? It's just a study session...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being nice in general...
Geh, don't look at me like that! You're making me blush...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
It's not like I care about you or anything, but be careful, okay?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you...
Baka! Don't think you can win me over with just a few compliments!
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought you'd be...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be going the same way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, so don't even think about it...
You're so careless, I swear... someone has to look out for you...
I don't know why I bother with you, you're always getting into trouble...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even ask...
You're really something else, you know that? Always causing trouble...
I-I'll go with you to the movies, but just as friends, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!

You're so annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm in a good mood, okay?
Stop teasing me, it's not f-funny!
I'm only spending time with you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Do you really think I'd go on a date with you? Hah!
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...

D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
Y-You'd better not tell anyone I said that, or I'll deny it...
I-I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I guess...
Baka! Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I like you or something...
I'm only being nice to you because it's convenient for me...

It's not like I care about your feelings or anything, but... maybe you should try to be more considerate...
H-Hey, don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want!
I'm not being stubborn, I just have a different opinion, o-okay?
G-Geez, stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'd never admit it out loud, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start going easy on you, b-because I'm not...

I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because... because I want to...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I didn't say I liked you, I just said you're... tolerable...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that! I'm not blushing...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy! You're always getting in the way...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I'm interested in you...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
B-Baka! Don't touch me! That's not okay...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, okay?
Stop teasing me! I'm not that easily embarrassed...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
G-Give me back my book! I wasn't done reading it yet...
I'm not blushing! It's just... just the heat, that's all...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but why are you talking to her?
Sh-Shut up and don't mention this to anyone, okay?
I-I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
D-Do you really think I'm that kind of person?!
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I-I didn't make this bento for you, it's just... leftovers...
W-Why do you always have to be so... so... annoying?!
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me when I'm blushing!
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want...
I-I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
T-Tell me you didn't really think I'd go on a date with you...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll...
Baka! Don't touch me without permission!
I'm only saying this because I have to, but...you're not completely useless...
I-It's not like I'm helping you out of the goodness of my heart, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I w-want to...
If you think I'm being nice to you, you're sadly mistaken...
Geh, d-don't get too close to me!
I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that!
It's not like I care about you, but... but don't do that again!
You're really annoying, but... I suppose you're not completely useless...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I'm only saying this because it's true, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
Geez, stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I mean, I'm not doing it for your sake, but... just be careful, okay?
I-It's not like I'm s-saying this because I care or anything...
D-Don't think you can just waltz in here and expect me to help you!
Baka! Can't you see I'm busy?! Just leave me alone!
I didn't do it for you, okay?! I just happened to... uh, notice you needed help...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that! It's embarrassing...
If you must know, I only came to this party because... because I had nothing better to do...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand through this, got it?! You're on your own!
D-Do you really think I'd go out of my way to help someone like you?! Ha!
I-If I'm being nice to you, it's only because... because I feel sorry for you, okay?! Don't get the wrong idea!
You're really dense, aren't you?! Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I actually want to...
S-Stop smiling at me like that! It's creeping me out...
I didn't mean to... uh, save you. It just kind of... happened...
D-Don't get too full of yourself just because I... occasionally tolerate your presence...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
B-Baka! Stop teasing me!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
I'm only helping you because I have to, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean we're friends now...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I was just, uh, testing your reflexes, that's all...
Y-You're so annoying, but I'll still... uh, tolerate you...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
G-Geez, don't get the wrong idea, okay?
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it...
B-Baka, stop smiling at me like that! It's creepy...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If anyone asks, I didn't save you from that dog, okay?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with food...
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be standing here...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You didn't see me crying, I just had something in my eye...
I'm only giving you this gift because I didn't want it anymore...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not looking at you, I'm just staring into space...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...

Y-You think you're so smart, don't you?
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
G-Good luck with your stupid exam, not that I care...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I-It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop looking at me with that stupid grin!
I only helped you because... because I didn't want to see you fail, okay?
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't mention this to anyone, okay?
I-I'm only doing this for myself, not for you...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
D-Don't get too close, I might... might get uncomfortable...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
J-Just don't expect me to go easy on you, okay?
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll... I'll deny it...
T-This is a one-time thing, so don't get any ideas...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... just the heat, yeah...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite.
Sh-shut up and don't look at me like that!
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
Geh, don't get the wrong idea, okay?
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
It's not like I'm worried about you or anything...
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought.
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...

If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're wrong...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? Personal space, please...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I don't know why I bother with you, but... maybe it's because you're not as bad as I thought...
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to help you study...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study!
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, it was just a coincidence...
W-Why are you following me? Can't you see I'm busy?
It's not like I made this bento for you, it's just... extra food...
D-Dumb idiot, of course I'm not jealous! Why would I be?
I only helped you with your homework because I felt sorry for you, g-got it?
I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not blushing!
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm not arguing, I'm just... passionately expressing my point of view...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but don't think this means I like you or anything!
I didn't mean to trip and fall into your arms, it was an accident, I swear!
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I only helped you because...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you must know, I was just in the area... coincidentally...
T-This doesn't mean I owe you anything, got it?
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you...
I-I swear, it's not like my heart skipped a beat or anything...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
G-Geez, don't get so excited, it's just a small favor...

I don't know why you're so happy, but stop it, it's embarrassing...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right, there's a difference...
I-I was just, uh, testing your reflexes, that's all...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, just wait till you see me when I'm really mad...
Y-You're not going to tell anyone about this, are you? It's our little secret...
I'm not going to hold your hand, but I'll walk with you to make sure you don't get lost...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me blush...

I-It's not like I care about you or anything...
G-get away from me, you're too close!
T-this has nothing to do with you, so mind your own business!
Y-you're really annoying, you know that?
I-I'm not going to fall for your tricks, so g-give up!
D-don't think that just because we're friends, you can...
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because I have to...
S-stop looking at me with those eyes, it's embarrassing!
Y-you're so clueless, it's almost... almost...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with cake.
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're really stupid!
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks, I guess.
Y-You're not allowed to talk to me like that! I'm the one who's always right!
D-Don't look at me like you can see right through me... it's embarrassing!
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... but I'll let you walk me home.
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat, yeah.
G-Good luck on your exam, not that you need it or anything...
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought you'd be.
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it until the day I die!
I-It's not like I'm helping you out of the goodness of my heart, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Sh-Shut up and don't mention this to anyone, okay?
You're really annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I-I was just, uh, testing you to see if you're worthy, yeah...
Gah, don't get too full of yourself just because I smiled at you!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... tolerant.
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's making me nervous...
I-I didn't mean to, but... you're kind of growing on me, I suppose...
Stop making me repeat myself, baka! I already told you no!
I'll help you this one time, but don't expect me to do it again...
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it until the end of time...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a good person, not because I like you...
T-That's not a gift, I just didn't want it anymore...
I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so... so annoying!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, it was just a coincidence...
W-Why are you sitting next to me? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not touching me? It's really annoying...
I-I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I didn't mean to bump into you, it was an accident...
I-I don't know why you're smiling at me, but stop it...
D-Don't think that just because I talked to you, I'm going to start liking you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Don't think I'm smiling at you, I just saw something funny!
Sh-shut up and don't look at me like that!
I didn't make this bento for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
D-don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping you because...
You're so annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
T-today's weather is nice, isn't it? Not that I care what you think...
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of... interesting...
Don't think this means I like you or anything, but... here, have a cookie...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you!
S-stop staring at me! You're making me nervous...
I-it's not like I trust you or anything, but... I'll let you walk me home...
B-baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying...
I didn't say I was happy to see you, I just... uh... noticed you...
Y-You're really clumsy, aren't you? Always tripping over your own feet...
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I-I was just, uh, testing your reflexes... yeah, that's it...
S-Shut up and don't distract me while I'm studying...
I didn't mean to blush, it's just... the room is really hot, okay?
Y-You're not going to tell anyone I helped you, are you? I have a reputation to maintain...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, but... just be careful, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-This is not a date, got it?
Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you?
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever or something...
D-Don't touch me, you'll get germs or something!
I swear, I'm only doing this for myself, not for you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
G-Good luck with your thing, I guess...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you must know, I was just... concerned about you...
T-This doesn't mean I'm going to start being nice to you!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, g-got it?
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you!
I-I swear, I'm only yelling at you because you're so stupid!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's... uh, never mind...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it!
G-Geez, stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
D-Don't think you can just waltz in here and... and... ugh, never mind!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I didn't say I liked you, I just said you're... tolerable...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy! You're going to get us both killed...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're really stupid...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it, okay?
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me, it's embarrassing!
If you think I'm doing this because I care about you, you're wrong...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it!
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything, got it?
Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice because...
I-I swear, I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not going to say it, so don't even ask...
D-Don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I-I'll never admit it, but maybe, just maybe, I...
Sh-Shh, don't tell anyone, but I might actually...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, okay? It's just a study session...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything, but...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Always getting under my skin...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I swear!
T-This is all just a coincidence, don't read into it!
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-I didn't mean to blush, it's just the heat!
D-Do I really need to spell it out for you? I'm not interested!
W-Why are you looking at me like that? Stop it!
I-I'm only being nice because it's my duty, not because I care!
G-Geez, don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being friendly!
I-If you think I'm doing this because I like you, you're sadly mistaken!
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... maybe I did it for you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I like you...

Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being polite...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't look at me...
G-Geez, can't you just leave me alone for once?
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
Y-You're really persistent, I'll give you that...
I-I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I guess...
Baka! Don't touch me, I can take care of myself!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop teasing me, it's not funny!

T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a... a study session...
W-Why are you looking at me like that?!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm going to start going easy on you...

Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
S-Stop smiling at me! It's creepy...

D-Don't get too close to me, I'm not comfortable with it!
I'm only teasing you because you're so easy to provoke!
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just my face is a little... hot...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not!
I-I don't need your help, but I'll accept it this one time...
D-Don't think this is the start of something, because it's not!
I-It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping because...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be here...
Y-You think I'm cute? D-Don't be ridiculous!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
If I'm helping you, it's because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't ask...
It's not like I like spending time with you, but...

S-Stop looking at me with those piercing eyes...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
Y-You're so clumsy, I swear... I'm only helping you because you'd get lost without me...

Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I swear, I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy, can't you even walk straight?
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...

Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't get any ideas...
I only yelled at you because you're being really stupid, not because I care...
G-Good job, I suppose, but don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it, got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!

I-I don't know what you're talking about! I wasn't blushing!
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
T-This is just a tactical alliance, don't get any romantic ideas...

D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
B-Baka! Stop smiling at me!

St-stop looking at me like that! It's embarrassing...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't get too close to me! Personal space, you know?

I-I don't know what you're talking about! Don't be ridiculous...
B-Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...

S-Stop smiling at me! It's annoying!
I'll only give you this gift because I don't want it anymore, not because I care...

I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Do I look like I'm interested in your stupid games?
H-Hey, don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping you because...
Baka! You're so clueless, it's annoying...

Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless.
D-Don't look at me like that! I was just... uh, just checking to see if you were okay...

If I'm blushing, it's just because I'm a-a angry, not because...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess.
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being nice!
I-I was just, uh, making sure you weren't getting into trouble, that's all...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad.
I'm not going to hold your hand, but... but maybe I'll walk with you for a bit.
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just sh-shut up, okay?
If I seem happy, it's just because... because I'm relieved, not because of you.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face?
It's not like I trust you or anything, but...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, g-got it?
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's embarrassing...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it...
D-Don't get too close, I don't want to catch your cooties...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... uh, admiring the view...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's distracting...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, ggot it?
S-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I had fun today...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not blushing...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but don't leave me behind...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous...
I-I was just, uh, testing my cooking skills... on you...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, baka...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
Y-You really are clueless, aren't you?
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
T-That doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Stop teasing me! I'm not a kid...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all friendly and stuff...
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
Y-You're really getting on my nerves, but... I guess I'll tolerate you...
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... I felt like it, okay?
Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
H-Hey, don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-I swear, it's not like I'm blushing or anything...!
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not doing this for you, I'm doing it because I want to...
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's making me uncomfortable...
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
G-Geez, don't get so excited just because I said something nice to you...
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I feel sorry for you...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not blushing, I just have a... a high temperature, that's all...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I didn't mean to save you, it just happened that way... don't read too much into it...
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again...
I'm not interested in you, so stop flirting with me, baka!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
Don't think that just because we're on the same team, I'm going to start being all friendly...
I-I was just, uh, testing your reflexes, that's all...
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it wasn't p-poisonous...
Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
F-Fine, I'll go to the movies with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it...
I'm not blushing, I just have a, uh, high body temperature...
D-Don't touch me, you'll get your cooties all over me!
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
You're so annoying, but I g-guess you're not completely useless...
I-It's not like I'm saying this because I care or anything...
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm going to start being all nice to you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I only did it because... because I didn't want to see you fail, okay?
T-This doesn't mean I'm going to go easy on you or anything!

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you or anything!
I-if you keep staring at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
Y-You're so stupid, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I didn't do it for your sake, I did it because... because I felt like it, okay?
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not going to fall for it!
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... but you're kind of... interesting...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...

Y-You really are clueless, aren't you?
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite...

It's not like I care about you or anything, but... be careful, okay?
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not going to fall for it...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for your sake...
G-Geez, don't make such a big deal out of it...

D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you keep staring at me, I'll...I'll get angry!
It's not like I'm blushing or anything...!

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being polite...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything, got it?
I-I swear, you're more annoying than a little sibling...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
D-Don't think you can just waltz in here and steal my attention...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, okay? It's just a study session...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're sadly mistaken!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
W-Why are you being so nice to me? It's suspicious...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that!

I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
D-Don't touch me, you'll get me dirty...
I-If you don't stop teasing me, I'll...I'll...
I didn't say I liked you, I just said you're not as annoying as I thought...
Baka! Don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing...

I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
S-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I think I might... might actually like this...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it until the day I die...
D-Don't get too full of yourself, I can still take you down any day...
I'm only being nice to you because... because it's convenient, that's all...

It's not like I'm worried about you or anything...!
I-I was just in the neighborhood, that's all...
Y-You shouldn't be so carefree all the time...
I'm only saying this because it's true, not because I care...
G-Good luck, I guess... Not that you need it...
I-I didn't mean to, it just sort of... happened...

I-I'm only helping you because I p-pity you!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this for your sake!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I-If you think I'm doing this because I like you, you're wrong!
Sh-Shut up and don't talk to me, okay?
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone...
Y-You're so annoying, but I'll tolerate you for now...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I-I'm not going to the festival with you, but I might go alone...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I'm n-not doing this for your benefit, got it?
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think this means I owe you anything, baka!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks for noticing me...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
I-I didn't mean to save you, it just happened...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand, but... but maybe just for a second...
S-Stop looking at me like you can see right through me!
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks for offering...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, it was just a reflex...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
If you think I'm going to hold your hand, you're sorely mistaken...
I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners for this project, it means anything...
I swear, I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
I didn't mean to smile when I saw you, it was just a nervous twitch...
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
Stop teasing me, or I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
I-It's not like I'm helping you because I like you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just didn't want to see you fail...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I feel sorry for you...
I-I won't admit it, but you're not as useless as I thought...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?!
I'll never say it out loud, but... you're not bad, I guess...
H-Hey, don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself... but thanks, I guess.
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, but you're not as bad as I thought.
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can touch my hair or anything!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun.
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, but we can walk together, I suppose.
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to help you study or anything.
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
D-Don't get too excited, but I might... possibly... like you a little bit... maybe.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway... to make sure it's not poisoned or something...
Dumb idiot, why are you looking at me like that?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'll have you know, I'm way more intelligent than you!
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I want to spend time with you...
G-Get away from me, personal space!
I-I'm not crying, I just have something in my eye...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? Personal space, please...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... just be careful, okay?
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, that's all...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
G-Good luck on your test, I suppose... not that I care or anything...
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, that's all...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start going easy on you, got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, okay?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're w-wrong!
T-That's not what I meant! Don't twist my words!
I don't need your help, but... but I'll accept it this one time...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
You're really annoying, but... I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I was just worried about you, that's all! Don't make a big deal out of it!
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it!
I'm not being kind to you, I'm just being... efficient...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought you'd be...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
If you think I'm doing this out of kindness, you're wrong!
I-I swear, I'm only tolerating you because...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested!
It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
I-I'm just doing my duty, that's all!
G-Get away from me, you're too close!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat!
Y-You're really annoying, but I'll help you anyway...
I-I don't know why I bother with you, but...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping because...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you must know, I was just... uh, testing the food...
It's not like I care about you, but... be careful, okay?
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you...
Y-You're so annoying, but... I suppose you're not completely useless...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
B-Baka! Don't touch me, you'll get me dirty!
I-I didn't do it for your sake, I did it because... because I felt like it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!

Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy...
I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? Personal space, please...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even see what's right in front of you...

D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite... there's a difference...
I-I was just, uh, testing your reflexes... yeah, that's it...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
G-Geez, don't look at me like that... it's embarrassing...
I'm only saying this because I have to, but... you're not completely useless...
I didn't mean to save you, it just sort of... happened...

T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
You're so annoying, but I'll play along with your silly game...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? Personal space, please!
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, no matter what!
You're really dense, aren't you? I mean, I like that about you... no, I don't!
I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
S-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I had fun today...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, okay? Just a study session...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're w-wrong...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle this myself...
It's not like I care about you or anything... I just don't want to see you get hurt, that's all...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Always getting into trouble...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you or anything...
G-Geez, can't you just leave me alone for once?
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, okay?
Baka! Why are you smiling at me?
I'm only doing this because I have to, g-got it?
It's not like I care about you or anything...!
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's creepy!
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, baka!
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty, nothing more...
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just my face is... hot...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I swear, I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-That's not what I meant! Don't twist my words!
If I'm going with you, it's just because I have nothing better to do...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
D-Don't look at me like that! I'm not some kind of heroine...
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not doing this for you, I'm doing it for myself, g-got it?
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything, but... be careful, okay?
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
T-That doesn't mean I like spending time with you...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken!
I-I won't admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought...
Stop looking at me! You're making me blush!
I'd never admit this to your face, but... your cooking is actually pretty good...
D-Don't think this means I trust you or anything...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... efficient...
It's not like I care about what happens to you, but... be careful, okay?
I-I don't know why I'm saying this, but... you're kind of... interesting...
Baka! Don't get too full of yourself!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's making me nervous...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
G-Good job, I guess... but don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I suppose...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
If I'm going with you, it's just because I don't want to be alone, okay?
I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so... so annoying!
You think you're so smart, don't you? W-Well, you're not!
I-I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it wasn't bad...
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own!
I'm not blushing! It's just... the temperature in here is really high...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misinterpret me!
I don't need your thanks, got it?
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's embarrassing...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought...
D-Don't get too close, personal space!
I'm only being nice to you because... uh, because I feel sorry for you...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I swear, I'm not doing this because I care about you...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's... uh, never mind...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
T-That's not a gift, it's just something I didn't need anymore...
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken!
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle it myself...
I-It's not like my heart skipped a beat when you said that...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it!
I wasn't thinking about you, I was just... lost in thought...
G-Get away from me, you're making me nervous!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? I'm not doing anything...
I don't need your help, but...thanks, I guess...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but...I'll give you the benefit of the doubt...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
Y-You're really annoying, but...I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only teasing you because I like seeing you get flustered...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy! You're going to hurt yourself...
I don't know why I'm always running into you, but...maybe it's not so bad...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start going easy on you, got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
S-Shut up and don't talk to me, okay?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
I-I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to embarrass me...
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to help you study...
I'm not doing this for you, I'm doing it because I want to...
D-Don't get too close, personal space, you know?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be going the same way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
D-Dinner? With you? N-No way, I'm busy...
T-Then why are you staring at me?!
I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that...
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything, but...
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but... I had fun today...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
I-I won't go to the movies with you, but... maybe I'll meet you there...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
I'm only doing this because I have to, g-got it?
You're so clueless, it's almost... amusing...
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... being polite...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping you because...
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
Baka! You're so slow, can't you see I'm trying to help?
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... I suppose you're okay...
I'll deny it if you ever say I said this, but... you're kind of... interesting...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Don't think I'm smiling because of you!
W-why are you looking at me? I was just... just checking the time...
Don't get the wrong idea, but... you're not completely useless...
I didn't make this bento for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
D-don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
If I'm helping you, it's only because... I feel sorry for you...
T-thank you... *ahem*... I mean, it was nothing special...
I'm not arguing, I'm just... explaining why I'm right...
Y-you're really annoying, but... I suppose you're tolerable...
I didn't say I liked you! I just... said you're not bad, okay?!
W-well, if you insist on knowing... I did have fun today...
I'm only going to the movies with you because... I want to see the film, not because of you!
D-don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a good person, not because I like you...
W-Why are you looking at me? I-I'm not doing anything...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I'm not jealous or anything, but why are you talking to her?
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you, for now...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to help you study...
I-I'm only sitting next to you because the other seats are taken, okay?
D-Don't get too excited, but... but I might, possibly, kind of like you...
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm not doing this for your sake, got it?
T-This is just a one-time favor, don't expect it again...
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I won't admit it, but you're kind of... tolerable...
Stop smiling, it's creepy!
I'm only being nice to you because it's convenient...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not going easy on you!
If anyone asks, I didn't do anything for you, okay?
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to help you?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just my face is... hot...
Idiot, don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I have to be...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't care...
It's not like I was waiting for you or anything... I just happened to be here...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're sadly mistaken...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
Stop looking at me like that! You're making me self-conscious...
I-I'll go to the movies with you, but just as friends, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll...
W-Why are you being so nice to me? It's creepy...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I didn't say I liked you or anything, so don't get your hopes up...
Baka! You're so clueless, it's almost cute...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, g-got it?
If you think I'm being nice, you're wrong!
T-This is just a one-time thing, don't expect it again!
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because I have to...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you?
D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I d-didn't mean to, it just sort of... happened...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
G-Good luck, I guess... Not that I care or anything...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not that bad, I suppose...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? Look away!
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks, I guess...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, but you're not as annoying as I thought...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I don't need your help, but... but thanks for offering, I suppose...
D-Don't look at me like that! I'm not some kind of cute animal or something...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Why are you always so clueless?
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, so don't get too excited...
H-Hey, stop staring at me! I'm trying to concentrate...
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... just be careful, okay?
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... tolerant...
G-Geez, can't you see I'm busy? Don't bother me!
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
Baka! You're so slow, I had to do it myself...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you.
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?

I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite.
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought.
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you.

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
If I'm with you, it's just because I have nothing better to do...
D-Dont think that just because we're together, I'm going to start being all lovey-dovey...
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... my favorite color is pink...
Y-You're really annoying, but... I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
G-Get away from me! I can take care of myself...
W-Why are you being so nice to me? It's creepy...

T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, g-got it?
D-Don't misunderstand, I'm not interested in you...
I-I'm just trying to help, not because I care about you...
Y-You're so annoying, but I'll still help you...
I-I won't admit it, but you're kind of... useful...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't think this means I'll go easy on you!

D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you keep staring at me, I'll...I'll get angry!
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a casual meeting...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being...efficient...
D-Do you mind not standing so close? You're invading my personal space...
I-I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...

Y-You really are something else, you know that? Always getting under my skin...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, but...but you're not as bad as I thought...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
Don't think that just because we're on the same team, I'll go easy on you...
I won't say it, so don't ask me to...
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
If you keep teasing me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
It's not like my heart is racing or anything, I just...uh...need to sit down...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I don't know why I'm telling you this, but...but be careful, okay?
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?

I don't know why I'm always getting stuck with you...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just, uh, the heat...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easy to provoke...

Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I pity you...
I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so... frustrating!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...

I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I only helped because...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-If you must know, I was just in the area...
It's not like I was waiting for you, g-got it?
D-Do you mind not standing so close?
I-I swear, it's just a coincidence we kept running into each other...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but not that annoying...
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but...
J-Just don't tell anyone I said that, okay?
I-I'm only going to this festival because...',
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all friendly...
G-Geez, stop looking at me like you're trying to see right through me...
I-I hope you don't expect me to... to hold your hand or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
Sh-shut up and don't look at me like that!
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I wanted to, okay?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?
If you think I'm going to go easy on you just because you're cute, you're wrong!
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only giving you this gift because I didn't want it anymore, not because I care about you...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
D-don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
S-shut up and don't look at me like that!
You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I-I won't admit it, but you're kind of... tolerable...
G-get away from me, you're too close!
I'm only being nice to you because I feel sorry for you, okay?
D-don't get the wrong idea, I'm not being friendly or anything!
I-it's not like I'm happy to see you, I just... didn't expect you to show up...
Y-you're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
S-stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever or something...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping you because...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Dumb idiot, can't you see I'm busy?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're so annoying, but I guess I'll tolerate you...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
S-Stop looking at me with those eyes, it's embarrassing...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I'm only going to the festival with you because I have nothing better to do...
B-Besides, someone has to make sure you don't get into trouble...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study!
I didn't make this cake for you, it's just... a spare...
W-What are you implying? I'm not blushing!
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, got it?
Sh-Shut up and don't talk to me, I'm busy!
I-If you want to walk with me, then don't expect me to talk to you...
I didn't save you because I like you, it's just... instinct...
You're really annoying, but... but don't die or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
St-Stop looking at me like that, it's creepy!
I-I mean, I was just walking by and saw you struggling, so...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start doing favors for you!
Baka! Can't you see I'm busy?! Don't bother me!
If I help you, it's not because I like you or anything...
I'm only doing this because I feel sorry for you, got it?
T-That's not what I meant! Don't twist my words!
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
H-Hey, don't get the wrong idea! I'm not interested in you!
I was just, uh, testing your reflexes... yeah, that's it...
D-Don't look at me like that! It's embarrassing...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... tolerant...
You're really annoying, but... I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I didn't say I liked it, I just said it was... acceptable...
Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I'm only talking to you because I have to, not because I want to...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you get too close, I'll...I'll push you away!
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a casual meeting...
Y-You're so stupid, how did you even survive this long?
I'm not blushing! It's just...it's just the heat...
D-Don't look at me like that! I'm not interested...
I-I'm doing this for myself, not for you! Don't get the wrong idea...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not playing along...
I-I don't need your help, but...but thanks, I guess...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's angry...
I-I'm going to ignore you from now on. Don't bother talking to me...
D-Do you mind not standing so close? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Shut up and don't look at me when I'm blushing!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because I want to...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
Baka! Why are you always so clueless?!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you need it or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I-I'll never forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...

Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I'm just being nice...
H-Hey, don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I-I don't know why I'm always stuck with you, but it's not like I'm complaining...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me blush...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
G-Geez, stop being so clumsy, you're going to get us both killed...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
B-Baka, don't try to hug me, I'm not a child...
I-It's not like I'm waiting for you or anything, I just happened to be in the area...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it!
If I'm going to the movies with you, it's just because I want to see the film...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, got it?
I'll only give you my notes because I don't want you to fail...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
I-I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty as a friend...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!

Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, okay?
Why are you looking at me? I-I was just, uh, looking in your direction...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me n-nervous...
It's not like I'm blushing or anything... I just have, uh, allergies...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so d-don't even think about it...
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, n-not because of you...
G-Get your eyes off me! I was just, uh, checking my phone...
I-I don't know why I'm always running into you, but it's really annoying...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
W-Why are you looking at me? It's not like I'm interesting or anything...
I don't know what you're talking about, and even if I did, I wouldn't tell you...
T-That's not a gift, it's just something I didn't need anymore...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I didn't mean to save you, it just happened that way...
D-Don't get too close, I don't want to catch your cold... or anything else from you...

If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right, g-got it?
D-Don't think that just because we're on the same team, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself, s-so just back off...
Y-You're not going to tell anyone about this, are you? It's a secret...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
Baka! Don't touch me, that's my favorite book...
I-I'm not looking at you, I'm just staring at the wall behind you...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you mess it up!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, g-got it?
If you say one more stupid thing, I'll...

You're so clueless, it's almost... almost...
I-I didn't mean to save you, it just happened!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested!

Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything... I just don't want to see you get hurt...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?

I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
G-Good luck on your exam, but don't expect me to help you study...
I-I won't go to the movies with you! Unless... unless you want to go to a really boring movie, then I might consider it...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'm only going to the beach with you because I want to get some sun...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're wrong!

W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, okay?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? Personal space, you know?
I-I'm only being nice to you because I feel sorry for you, that's all.
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I-It's not like I care about what you think, but... just be quiet for once, okay?
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm n-not going to go to the festival with you, so d-don't ask me again!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all excited!
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I might have had fun today...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's distracting...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't think you owe me anything...
G-Good job, I guess... But don't expect me to start praising you all the time...
I didn't say I liked it, I just said it was... tolerable...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's creeping me out!
I-I mean, I was just walking by and saw you struggling, so...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping because...
H-Hey, stop staring at me! It's not like I'm blushing...
Baka! You're so clumsy, I swear...

S-Stop smiling at me! It's annoying...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'm smarter...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? Personal space, you know...
I-It's not like I'm interested in you or anything, got it?
W-Why are you looking at me like that? Stop it...
I-I was just, uh, testing my cooking skills, that's all...
Y-You're not going to tell anyone about this, are you?...
I-I don't need your help, so just leave me alone...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a nice person, okay?
Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so frustrating...
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?...
It's not like my heart skipped a beat when you touched me, that's just ridiculous...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
If you keep teasing me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...

D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? Personal space, you know...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's upset...
I-I didn't do it for your sake, so don't thank me or anything...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that I care or anything...
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, that's all...

D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I like you or something!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I only did it because I felt like it, not because of you...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misunderstand!
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!

D-Don't think that just because I'm smiling, I've forgiven you!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask!
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
I-I didn't do it for your sake, g-got it?!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, so don't get the wrong idea!
D-Don't misunderstand, I'm only doing this because it's my duty!
You're really annoying, but... but I'll help you this one time...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
I'll never say it, but... maybe I was a little happy to see you...

If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, not because I want to...
D-Do you mind? Some of us are trying to study here...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're not allowed to talk to me like that!
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
T-This is none of your business, so just mind your own...
I'm not being mean, I'm just being honest...

Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm doing this out of kindness, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, not because I enjoy your company!
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat!
Y-You're so annoying, but I suppose you're somewhat useful...
I-If you tell anyone I helped you, I'll deny it!
T-This is a one-time thing, don't expect me to do it again!
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!

Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
I don't care about your opinions, but... but your taste in music isn't that bad...
T-This is not a date, okay? It's just a... a study session!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...

D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
You're really something else, you know that? I-I mean, not that I care...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... tolerant.
G-Good job, I suppose. Not that it's any of my business...
If you think a simple apology will make everything okay, you're wrong...
I-I was just trying to help, not that you deserve it...
Stop looking at me like that! It's creepy...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Dummy! You're so slow, I got tired of waiting!
H-Hey, don't think this means I like you or anything...
B-Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I didn't make this cake for you, I just... happened to have extra...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but don't get hurt, okay?
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice because...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easily embarrassed...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just... didn't hate it...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Annoying, but...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
I-I'm only walking with you because it's on my way home, that's all...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, g-got it?
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I only helped you because I p-pitied you...
If you tell anyone I baked this cake for you, I'll d-deny it!
T-This is just a friendly gesture, don't read too much into it...
I'm only spending time with you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Do you mind? I'm trying to ignore you here...
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything, but...
I-I won't forgive you if you lose to me at this game!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I swear, I'm only doing this for myself, not for your sake...
G-Get away from me! You're making me nervous...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll...
D-Don't think you can just waltz in here and steal my heart, baka!
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice, I've gone soft!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, that's all!
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken!
T-This is just a one-time thing, don't expect me to always save you!
I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not being tsundere at all!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me, you're making me uncomfortable!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you, got it?
I-I swear, I'm not being mean, I'm just... passionately expressing myself!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
If you say one more thing, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I'm not going to apologize, it's not my fault you're so clueless!
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop asking!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you?
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not being nice to you!
I-I swear, you're more trouble than you're worth...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah...
B-Besides, I can take care of myself, so don't worry about me!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a gift, I just didn't want it anymore...
Don't think this means I like you or anything, got it?
I'm only eating with you because I'm starving, not because I want to...
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll get angry...
You're really dense, aren't you? I was obviously trying to help...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it wasn't poisonous...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever or something...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face?
It's not like I trust you or anything, I just... uh... need your help...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being polite...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only teasing you because I care, sh-shut up and don't tell anyone...
G-Geez, don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing...
I-If you keep staring at me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again...
W-Why are you being so nice to me? It's creepy...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, d-don't even think about it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's making me uncomfortable!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, so don't get your hopes up...
Shut up and don't talk to me, I'm trying to study...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just leave me alone...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's annoying...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't think anything of it...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I'm only doing this for myself, not for your benefit, g-got it?
G-Good luck with your exam, but don't expect me to help you study...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself, so just back off...
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice to you, I'm going to start going easy on you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This is not a date, it's just a study session...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I've got news for you...
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty as a friend...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I-If you don't stop teasing me, I'll...I'll...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I don't know why I bothered helping you, it's not like you'll ever appreciate it...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone I was worried about you...
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
D-Don't think that just because I smiled, I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-I'm not afraid of you, I'm just... cautious...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't get too close, I don't want to catch your cold... or anything else from you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What's with the staring? Can't you see I'm busy?
F-Fine, I'll go to the movies with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because I want to!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
G-Geez, can't you see I'm trying to study here? Don't bother me...
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty, not because I like you or anything...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I'm interested in you or anything...

I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
G-Geez, stop following me around! Can't you see I'm busy?
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself, b-but thanks for offering...
S-Stop making me blush! It's so... so embarrassing...

I-I'm not blushinging! It's just the heat, okay?
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'm not impressed...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so stop asking me!
G-Good luck on your test, not that you need it or anything...
I-I didn't buy this cake for you, I just happened to have an extra slice...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I'm only teasing you because you're so... annoying...
I-I didn't mean to make you happy, it just sort of... happened...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you...
Don't think this means I like you or anything, baka!
T-This is just a one-time thing, so don't get the wrong idea...
Shut up and don't look at me, I'm trying to concentrate!
I did it for myself, not for you, so don't thank me!
If you tell anyone I was nice to you, I'll d-deny it...
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
D-Don't get too close, I don't want to catch your germs...
It's not like I'm going to cook for you again, so don't expect it...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I'M NOT CRYING, I JUST HAVE DUST IN MY EYE, OKAY?!
I don't know why I bother with you, you're so... so... UGH!
Don't think you can just waltz in here and make me do your bidding, g-got it?

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only walking with you because it's on my way!
You're so annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad.
I-I'm not jealous, I just don't want to see you with anyone else!
T-This is not a date, got it?!
I'm only giving you this because I don't need it anymore, not because I care!
If you say one more thing, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!

Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it!
I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so... frustrating!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's being nice!
It's not like I'm looking out for you or anything, I just don't want to see you get hurt...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?

You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I-I don't care about your feelings, but maybe, just maybe, I'll consider them
D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it
Geh, don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this for myself!
I-I swear, it's not like I'm concerned about you... at all
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
You're really something else, you know that? I-I mean, not that I'm impressed or anything
W-Why are you still here? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-If you think I'm going to go easy on you, you're wrong
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
T-This isn't a date, got it?
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, not because I like you!
D-Don't touch me! I can handle it myself...
I-I'm not embarrassed, I'm just... flustered...
It's not like I care about what you think, but... maybe try to dress better?
I wasn't thinking about you, I was just... lost in thought...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask!
T-This gift is just something I found lying around, don't read too much into it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...

D-Don't think this means I'm going easy on you, got it?
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I didn't say I liked your gift, I just said it was... interesting...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not blushing, I just... have a rash...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? It's really annoying...
I-I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
D-Don't get too close, I don't want to catch your... clumsiness...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything... I just don't want to see you fail...
Shut up and don't look at me, I'm trying to concentrate...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I just arrived at the same time, that's all...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
G-Good luck on your exam, but don't expect me to be cheering for you...
I'm not being nice to you, I just don't want to see you cry...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I suppose it's okay if you sit next to me, but don't think this means anything...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
I didn't save you because I like you or anything, it just happened that way...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't touch me! I can do it myself...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I won't go to the movies with you, but I might just happen to be at the same theater...
I-I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I suppose...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm n-not going to admit it, but you're kind of... tolerable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything... I just don't want you to get hurt.
Stop looking at me! You're making me blush!
I-I swear, I'm not doing this for your sake... it's just for my own satisfaction.
D-Don't think that just because we're together, it means I'll go easy on you!
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad.
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it!
G-Geez, don't get so excited... it's just a small gift.
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... just being polite!
B-Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I-I don't know why I'm sticking up for you, but... just don't make me regret it!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
D-Do I really have to sit next to you on the train?
It's not like I'm protecting you, I just don't want to see you get hurt...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easy to provoke...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I didn't mean to trip and fall into your arms, it was an accident...
Y-You're not going to tell anyone about this, are you?
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this for your sake!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm doing this out of kindness, you're wrong!
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misunderstand!
I'm not being nice, I'm just... tolerant.
D-Do you mind not looking at me? It's distracting...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-I'm only going with you because... because I have nothing better to do!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I like you or something!
I-I'm just saying this because... because it needs to be said, okay?!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't care...
Sh-shut up and don't talk to me, okay?
It's not like I trust you or anything, but...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? I can feel your breath...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
G-Good luck with that, I suppose... Not that I care or anything...
I-I won't say it, so don't even think about asking me to...
D-Don't think that just because we're talking, I've forgiven you or anything...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, g-got it?
If you think I'm being nice to you, you're wrong!
T-This is just a one-time favor, don't expect it again!
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even take a hint!
I'm only saying this because I have to, not because I want to...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's uncomfortable...
I-I swear, I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
If you tell anyone I helped you, I'll deny it!
G-Good luck with your thing, I guess... Not that I care or anything...
I'm not going to hold your hand through this, figure it out yourself!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, got it?
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're tolerable...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? Don't think you can just stare at me all day...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I just... uh... appreciate your efforts...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't get any ideas...
Y-You're so clumsy, I swear, I'm only sticking around to make sure you don't hurt yourself...
I'm not talking to you, I'm just... just talking to myself, y-yes, that's it...
G-Good luck on your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I wanted to see that film anyway, d-don't think it's a date or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-There's no way I'd ever fall for someone like you!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're so clumsy, I swear...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
D-Don't think this means I owe you one or anything...
I-I was just testing you, don't get too full of yourself!
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you...
B-Besides, someone has to keep an eye on you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, okay?
Baka! Stop smiling at me!
I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
T-That doesn't mean I like you or anything...

I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
D-Do you mind not looking at me like that? It's creepy...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, not because I want to...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't make this bento for you, I just... happened to have extra...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're... you're wrong!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, not because I like you...
St-Stop teasing me! I'm not blushing...
I don't know why I'm always stuck with you, but it's not like I'm complaining...
D-Do you really think I'd go on a date with you? Ha! Don't be ridiculous...
I-I'm not competing with you, I just want to... prove that I'm better...
If you want to be friends, then stop being so... so annoying!
I didn't save you because I like you, I just... didn't want to see you get hurt...
T-Turn off that camera! I don't want you taking pictures of me...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!

D-Do you mind not looking at me? It's really annoying...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy! You're going to hurt someone...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want...

Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!

G-Geez, don't get so excited, it's not like it's a big deal or anything...
I-If you must know, I was just... uh, just concerned about you, that's all...
D-Don't think this means I owe you one or anything, because I don't!

I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!

W-Why are you staring at me? It's not like I'm interesting...
I didn't make this bento for you, I just... happened to have extra...
T-That's not a compliment, got it? Don't flatter me...
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I like you...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice to you because...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...

D-Do I really have to explain why I'm blushing? Just drop it!
I wasn't waiting for you, I just arrived at the same time, c-coincidence!
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I p-pity you...
I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not interested in you at all! Really!

I'm only going to the festival with you because... I have nothing better to do...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're... you're wrong!
Gah, stop looking at me like that, it's embarrassing!

If you say one more stupid thing, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I'm not being tsundere, I'm just... passionate about disagreeing with you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying...

I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... maybe I'll see you at the movies tomorrow...
I-If you think I'm going to hold your hand, you're wrong... but don't let go, it's slippery...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
D-Don't think that just because I cooked for you, I'm going to start doing it all the time...
I'm not laughing because of you, I'm just... amused by the situation...
I won't admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought you'd be...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing...

I-I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I guess...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's really annoying...
I'm not being nice to you, I just feel sorry for you, okay?
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything...
I-If you tell anyone I did this, I'll deny it...
You're so clueless, it's almost... amusing...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's creepy...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice because...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself...
B-Baka, don't touch me! Personal space, you know?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, but... you're not as bad as I thought.
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... I had a weird dream last night...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
W-Why do you always have to be so close to me? Can't you see I'm trying to concentrate?
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me.
D-Don't tell anyone, but... I think I might actually like this stupid school event.
I-It's not like I'm saying this because I care or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just didn't want to see you get hurt!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be here...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
It's not like I did it for you, I just did it because... because I felt like it!
D-Do you mind not looking at me like that? It's creepy...
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You're not going to start thinking I'm nice or something, are you?
I-I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?!
J-Just don't expect me to always be there to save you, got it?
I wasn't trying to protect you, I was just trying to protect myself...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I didn't make this cake for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
W-Why are you looking at me? Look away!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not true! I don't like you or anything...
Don't think this means I'm going easy on you, got it?
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you?
I didn't say I liked your gift, I just said it was... interesting...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I didn't say I like you or anything, so d-don't get your hopes up!
T-This is not a date, it's just a... a study session...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't tease me!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't think you owe me anything...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, s-so don't even think about it!
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I'm only being nice to you because I p-pity you, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
I don't care about your opinion, but... maybe you're not as stupid as I thought.
T-This is not a date! We're just studying together, okay?
I-I won't go to the movies with you, but... I might watch the same movie at home.
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat, yeah.
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty, not because I like you...
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to help you study.
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right! There's a difference!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? Don't you have something better to do?
It's not like I'm embarrassed or anything, but c-can we please just go already?
I don't know what you're talking about, so d-don't ask me!
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I-I was just, uh, trying to protect you from harm... yeah, that's it...
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? W-Wipe it off!
I'm n-not going to say it, so d-don't even ask me to...
G-Get your hands off me! I can walk on my own...
I-I didn't do it for your sake, so d-don't thank me or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
Fine, I'll go to the movies with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
It's not like I trust you or anything, I just don't have a choice...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easy to provoke...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
G-Geez, can you just leave me alone? I'm trying to study...
I-I don't know why I'm even talking to you, you're so... annoying...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I'm your friend or anything...
Shut up and don't look at me! I'm not blushing...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't think that just because we're on the same team, we're friends now...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
G-Geez, stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you...
B-Besides, someone has to keep an eye on you...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
I-I was just, uh, checking if you were doing your homework, that's all...
D-Don't think I'm going easy on you just because you're my friend!
T-This cake is, um, really good... I mean, not that I made it for you or anything...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
Y-You're really clumsy, aren't you? I mean, I'm not saying I'm worried about you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, but... I think you look pretty cool when you're determined like that...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be in the area... at the same time... every day...
S-Shut up and don't tease me, okay? I'm just trying to help...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
G-Geez, don't be so careless! You're going to get yourself killed...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? I mean, not that I'm impressed or anything...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me... uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I only helped you because I felt sorry for you, not because I like you...
T-This is just a coincidence, I wasn't waiting for you...
Y-You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, not because I enjoy your company...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being polite...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I only yelled at you because you're being stupid, not because I care...
Y-You'd better not tell anyone I smiled at you...
I-If you think I'm going to hold your hand, you're crazy...
I'm not competing with you, I just don't want to lose...
Baka! Don't think you can win against me that easily...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same foods as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
H-Hey, don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time...
I-I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to embarrass me...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's creepy...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
G-Geez, can't you just leave me alone for once?
I-I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I guess...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so d-don't ask me!
Hmph, you think you're so smart, don't you?
D-do I look like I need your help?
Baka! Don't touch me, got it?
I-It's not like I'm doing this for your sake...
W-what's it to you, anyway?
Geh, don't get the wrong idea, okay?
I'm only going with you because... because I have to!
D-don't think this means I like you or anything!
You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're kind of... tolerable...
H-hey, don't look at me like that! I-I can take care of myself!
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
D-don't get too full of yourself, or you'll be in for a disappointment...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Why are you looking at me? I-I was just, uh, looking in your direction...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it...
You're really annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you, for now...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy! You're going to hurt someone...
I'm doing this for myself, not for you! So, d-don't think you owe me or anything...
T-Turn around! I need to... uh, fix my hair...
I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... but be careful, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's making me uncomfortable!
I-I suppose it's okay if you sit next to me, but don't think this means anything...
W-Why are you still following me? Can't you see I'm busy?
I didn't do it for you, I just... happened to bake some extra cookies...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy! You're going to hurt someone...
I-If you must know, I was just... testing the water temperature for someone else...
D-Don't think that just because we're on the same team, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just... explaining why I'm right...
W-What's it to you what I'm reading? Mind your own business...
I-It's not like I was waiting for you or anything, I just... got here early...
B-Baka! Don't touch me! I can do it myself...
I-I suppose you're not completely useless, but don't expect any special treatment...
D-Don't look at me like that! I'm just... concerned about the project...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? It's really distracting...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... I'll give you the benefit of the doubt...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you or anything...
G-Geez, don't look at me like that! It's embarrassing...
I don't know why I'm even talking to you, but... just don't expect me to be all nice and friendly, okay?
W-What's with all the questions? Can't you just leave me alone?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
B-Baka! Stop smiling at me!

H-Hey, don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I-I was just, uh, testing your reflexes, yeah...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-shut up!
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I-I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...

I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
You're really dense, aren't you? I'm only being nice because...

I didn't say I liked you, so stop misunderstanding!
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm not interested...
Y-You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, that's all...

Baka! Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-I'm not doing this because I like you or anything... it's just because...
Y-You're really getting on my nerves, but at the same time... I don't know, it's just so... frustrating!

I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm only going to the festival with you because... because I don't have anything better to do...
D-Don't think this means I trust you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't need your help, but... but if you insist, I suppose it couldn't hurt...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, it's just a friendly gesture...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't get any ideas...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to be nice?
I'm only being nice to you because you're so p-pitiful, okay?
G-Good luck on your exam, but don't expect me to be all cheery about it...
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it, okay?
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but why are you talking to her?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy! You're always getting in the way...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Don't think this means we're friends or anything, I'm just being polite...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
If I'm going with you, it's only because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being nice...
I-I didn't say I was going to protect you, I just... happened to be there...
You're really d-dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'm not blushing! I just... have a fever, that's all...
Y-You're not allowed to talk to me like that! I'm the one who's always right!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, okay?!
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I think your joke was kind of funny...
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-If you want to be friends, then stop calling me cute!
It's not like I was waiting for you or anything, I just happened to be here...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I didn't do it for your sake, I just didn't want to lose to you...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything... I just don't want to see you fail...
H-Hey, don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-I swear, it's not like I'm blushing or anything... it's just the heat...
D-Don't look at me like that! I'm not some kind of fragile doll...
I-If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
G-Good luck on your exam, but don't expect me to be all smiles if you pass...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right... there's a difference!
S-Stop teasing me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I-It's not like I care about your opinion or anything, but... maybe you're not as stupid as I thought...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I-I was just, uh, testing the food to make sure it's not poisonous...
Y-You really are something else, aren't you? So clueless...
I didn't save you because I like you or anything, g-got it?
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, that's all...
S-Stop smiling at me like that, it's really annoying...
I'm not blushing, I just have a, uh, a fever or something...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
G-Geez, can't you just leave me alone for once?
I didn't mean to, uh, bump into you like that, sorry...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
B-Baka! Stop making me blush!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, okay? It's just a study session...
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
D-Don't look at me like that! You're making me uncomfortable...
I swear, I'm only doing this for myself, not for you...
B-Baka! You're so dense! Can't you see I'm trying to help you?
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
T-Turn around! I need to change, and I don't want you seeing me like this!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I didn't say I like you or anything, so d-don't get your hopes up...
T-This is not a date, it's just a study session... with one other person...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so d-don't even think about it...
W-Why are you staring at me? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks for offering, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with food... and games...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're d-delusional!
I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's not like I'm f-following you or anything...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
It's not like I care about your opinion, but... y-you're not completely wrong...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah...
If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... I felt like it, okay?
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you or anything...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
Y-You're so clumsy, I swear... someone has to take care of you.
I won't deny it... I did enjoy spending time with you, okay?
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I don't know why I'm always stuck with you, but... just be grateful, I guess.
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice to you because...
Gah, stop teasing me! I'm not that easy to provoke!
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought.
I'm only going to the festival with you because... I don't have anything better to do.
Y-You'd better not tell anyone I said this, but... I think you're kind of... interesting.
I-I didn't mean to, but... I think I might have, uh, started to...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
T-That's not a gift, I just found it on the ground and thought you might want it...
I don't know why I'm helping you, but don't think this means I like you!
S-Shut up and don't tease me, it's not funny!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
D-Do you mind not standing so close? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
You're really annoying, but... but don't die or anything, okay?
I won't go to the movies with you, but... maybe I'll meet you there by coincidence...
I-it's not like I trust you or anything, I just... need your help right now...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
Sh-shut up and don't look at me like that!
Y-You really are clueless, aren't you?
I won't deny it... I just happened to be in the area, okay?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
It's not like I'm worried about you, I just... care about everyone's safety!
G-Geez, don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice!
I-I'll only go to the festival with you if you promise not to embarrass me!
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I'm only saying this because I have to, but... you're not completely useless.
D-Don't expect me to always be there to save you, got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it wasn't p-poisonous...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? Personal space, please...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but who's that girl you're talking to?
I-I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I didn't mean to save your life, it just happened accidentally...
D-Don't think this means I owe you one, because I don't...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
I-I won't admit it, but you're not as stupid as I thought...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
G-Geez, stop making me repeat myself! I already said no!
I-I'll do it, but not because I want to, because I have to...
Y-You're really something else, aren't you? Always getting into trouble...
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? It's not like I'm interested...
I don't care about your opinion, but... your hair looks nice today...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, but... you're not as annoying as I thought...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to help you study or anything...
D-Don't get too close, I don't want to catch your cold... or your feelings...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're even more annoying than I thought...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess.
D-Don't touch me! I can handle this on my own...
You're really dense, aren't you? I was just trying to be nice...
I-I was just, uh, testing your reflexes... yeah, that's it...
Stop teasing me! I'm not laughing, I'm just... appreciating the absurdity of the situation...
I'm not going to fall for your charming smile, so don't even try...
G-Good job, I suppose... but don't expect me to praise you or anything...
If you think you can win me over with food, you're sadly mistaken...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat, yeah...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, not because I enjoy your company...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I-I'll never admit it, but... maybe I was a little worried about you...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you now...
I-I mean, I'm only helping you because I have to...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll...
It's not like I'm doing this for your sake, got it?
T-This is just a favor, don't get the wrong idea...
You're so annoying, but...but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just...appreciate the effort...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I-I'm only going to the festival with you because...because I have nothing better to do...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I don't need your help, but...thanks, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's making me uncomfortable!
I suppose it's not like I have anything better to do... fine, let's study together.
T-That's not a gift, I just found it on the ground and thought you might want it...
H-Hey, don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I don't know why you're so happy, it's not like we won or anything...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care or anything...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?!
I suppose you're not as stupid as you look... but don't get too full of yourself.
I didn't do it for your sake, I just didn't want to see you get hurt, that's all...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny anymore...
I-I'm going to go practice now, alone. Don't follow me.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a good person, not because I like you...
T-This is not a date, okay? Just a study session...
You're really d-dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to be nice...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not looking at me like that? It's unsettling...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even ask...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only giving you this gift because I didn't want it anyway...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Always getting on my nerves...
I-I'll go to the movies with you, but just as friends, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not blushing!
Y-You think I'm cute? H-Hmph, don't be ridiculous!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be here at the same time...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll get angry!
D-Do you really think I'd go on a date with you? H-Hmph, don't be so full of yourself!
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this out of kindness!
Baka! You're so clueless, it's annoying!
I-If you must know, I was just... concerned about you...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't twist my words!
Ugh, fine. If it'll make you happy, I'll go with you...
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
W-Why are you staring at me? Look away!
I-I didn't say I liked you or anything...!
D-Drop it, okay? It's not like it's any of your business...
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-I'm only saying this because... because it's true, okay?! Not because I care!
G-Geez, stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm not going to thank you or anything, but... you're not completely useless...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? It's not like I'm doing anything interesting...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself! But, um, thanks for offering...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just, uh, the heat...
Y-You think I'm cute? D-Don't be ridiculous!
I'm only teasing you because you're so gullible, baka...
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it, okay?
S-Stop looking at me with those eyes! It's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
I-I'm just trying to help, d-don't misunderstand...
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice to you, I like you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? Don't you have something better to do?
I didn't say I like you or anything... I just think you're mildly tolerable.
Sh-shut up and don't tell anyone, but I might have bought you a gift...
D-Don't think this means I'm going easy on you, I'll still beat you at that game!
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not the worst person I've met.
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm just doing it because I want to!
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I didn't mean to save you, it just happened that way... don't read too much into it!
W-Why do you always have to be so close to me? Can't you just give me some space?
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this out of kindness!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're wrong!
It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
S-Shut up and don't look at me, okay?!
I'm only yelling at you because you're being stupid!
D-Do you really think I care about what you think of me?!
I-I was just, uh, testing your reflexes... Yeah, that's it...
G-Get away from me, you're bothering me!
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I owe you something!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
S-Stop staring at me, it's making me uncomfortable!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Don't think I'm smiling because of you!
Sh-shut up and don't get too close!
I'm only helping you because I have to, g-got it?
D-don't misunderstand, I'm not being nice to you!
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad.
I-it's not like I care about your feelings or anything...
Stop looking at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I'm not blushing, I just... I just have a fever, okay?
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're... you're really weird!
I'm only teasing you because you're so gullible, baka!
D-don't expect me to always be there for you, got it?
I-I mean, it's not like I trust you or anything, but...
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be going the same way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...:
D-Do you mind not looking at me when I'm eating?
I-I swear, it's not like I was waiting for you... I just arrived early, that's all...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... be careful, okay?
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it...
Baka! Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I guess you're not as bad as I thought... but don't expect me to start being all friendly or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
Y-You're so clumsy, can't you even walk straight?
I don't know why I'm helping you, but don't think it's because I like you...
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a study session...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I'm only eating with you because I'm starving, not because I want your company...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easily flustered...
I wasn't looking at you, I was just... checking the time...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I-I'm not jealous, I just don't want to see you with anyone else... I mean, it's not like that...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I-I mean, I was just walking by and saw you struggling, so...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start doing favors for you!
Baka! You're so clumsy, it's a wonder you survive the day!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
Sh-Shut up and don't make a big deal out of it, okay?
If I helped you, it's because I pitied you, not because I like you!
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to be nice...
I-It's not like I'm interested in you or anything! Don't get the wrong idea!
Gah, stop smiling at me like that! It's annoying!
I only shared my lunch with you because I didn't want it to go to waste...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're invading my personal space...
I wasn't staring at you, I was just... looking in your general direction...
You're really something else, you know that? Always getting into trouble...
I-I'll only go to the festival with you if you promise not to embarrass me...
I-I mean, I was just walking by and saw you struggling, so...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start doing favors for you or anything!
Baka! Why are you always so clumsy?
It's not like I'm worried about you or anything... I just didn't want to have to fill out the paperwork if you got hurt.
I'm only helping you because I don't want to hear you whining about it anymore!
S-Shut up and let me concentrate! I'm trying to...
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it, okay?
D-Do you mind not staring at me? It's kind of... distracting.
You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad.
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me.
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... I suppose you're better than nothing.
Just don't expect me to start being all nice to you now, got it?
I'm only being nice to you because I have to, not because I want to!
S-Stop smiling at me like that! It's creepy!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I only helped you because I felt sorry for you, g-got it?
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're even more stupid than I thought...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
D-Do you really think I care about your opinion?
It's not like I've been thinking about you or anything... shut up!
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone I said that...
T-This is just a one-time exception, don't expect me to do it again...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's being nice...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you...
G-Geez, stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-I swear, I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I-I mean, I was just in the area, so I thought I'd drop by...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start doing you favors or anything!
Baka! You're so clumsy, I swear...
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you mess it up...
T-That's not what I meant! Stop grinning at me!
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
I-I was just, uh, testing your reflexes... Yeah, that's it...
Stop looking at me like that! It's embarrassing...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... efficient...
D-Do you mind not standing so close? You're making me nervous...
I don't know what you're talking about, so stop asking me...
You're really dense, aren't you? I mean, I like that about you... No, I don't!
I'm only saying this because I have to, not because I want to...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, we're friends or something!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's embarrassing...
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because I wanted to, okay?
D-Don't get too full of yourself just because I talked to you...
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty, g-got it?
Y-You're really something else, I'll give you that...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
W-Why are you looking at me? It's not like I'm interesting or anything...
I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not blushing...
T-This is just a one-time thing, don't think it means I'll always help you...
I-I swear, it's not like I'm worried about you or anything... Stop getting into trouble!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can tell me everything...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being nice in general... Don't read too much into it...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself... But thanks, I guess...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask!
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I feel sorry for you...
T-This doesn't mean I trust you, got it?
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you!
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this for your sake!
You're really annoying, but... but I won't let you get hurt!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat!
If you think I'm being nice to you, you're wrong!
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with pizza...
D-Don't think that just because I'm sitting next to you, I like you or anything...
I-I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, that's all...
Y-You're so clumsy, I swear, I'm only helping you because someone has to...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
G-Good luck on your test, not that I care or anything...
I-I didn't buy this cake for you, I just like cake, okay?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-It's not like I trust you or anything, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
B-Baka! Don't touch me, I can do it myself!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be going the same way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because I have to...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy!
I-I didn't mean to say that, just forget it...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a compliment, it's just a fact...
Why are you looking at me? I-I was just looking away...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was edible...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever...
It's not like I was waiting for you or anything, I just happened to be here...
Y-You're really annoying, but not in a bad way...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I didn't say I'd help you with your homework, I just... happened to be studying the same thing...
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just two friends eating dinner together...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-I'm not jealous or anything, but why are you talking to her?
D-Do you really think I'm that kind of person? Someone who'd get all fluttery just because you're around?
I'm only walking with you because it's on my way home, not because I want to spend time with you...
Y-You really are something else, you know that? Always barging in and expecting me to... to...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I didn't mean to saves your life back there, it just kind of... happened...
S-Stop calling me cute! I'm not cute, I'm just... just annoyed!
W-Why do you always have to be so nice to me? Can't you just be mean for once?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm going with you to the movies, it's just because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
T-This isn't a date, so stop acting like it is!
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes, s-stop involving me!
D-Do you mind not looking at me when I'm trying to concentrate?
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, s-so don't get any ideas...
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to be all smiles about it...
I'll go to the beach with you, but only because I want to get some sun, not because I want to have fun with you...
You're really something else, b-but I'm not going to fall for your charming act...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!

If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop smiling at me!
D-Don't touch me, you'll get your cooties all over me!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
I wasn't worried about you, I was just... concerned about the weather...
It's not like I like spending time with you or anything, but...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're tolerable...

Y-You're not going to tell anyone I said that, are you?
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I didn't mean to trip and fall into your arms, it was an accident!
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that weak...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of your company...
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to help you study or anything...

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me, I'm trying to concentrate!
Baka! Why are you always so clueless?
I-I didn't save you because I like you, it's just because... uh, because...
T-That's not a gift, it's just something I didn't need anymore...
D-Do you really think I'd go on a date with someone like you?
I-If you keep staring at me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
Y-You're so annoying, but... but don't think this means I'll go easy on you...

S-Stop smiling at me, it's really annoying...
I-I don't know why I'm helping you, but don't think it's because I like you...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
B-Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and... and...

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with dinner... and a movie...
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken!
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself, you know!
I'm not being nice to you, I just don't want to deal with your whining...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I swear, I'm only doing this because it's my duty as a classmate...
G-Give me back my book, I didn't lend it to you!
I-I don't care about your opinions, but... maybe you're not completely wrong this time...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable!

D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!

You're really annoying, but I g-guess you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't expect it!

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
I don't care about your opinions, but... but your taste in music is not bad, I guess.

Y-You're not allowed to smile at me like that, it's... it's distracting...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever or something...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're wrong...
I-I'll never admit it, but... maybe I did it for you...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice...
I'm not being tsundere, I'm just... passionately expressing myself...
Y-You're so stupid, why can't you just understand me?
I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
I'm only saying this because I have to, but... be careful, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Do I look like I'm interested in your stupid games?
Baka! Don't think that just because I helped you, I like you or something...
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, g-got it?
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I didn't say I was going to protect you, so don't get any weird ideas...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I suppose you're not as useless as I thought, but don't expect me to go easy on you...
G-Good luck on your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I didn't make this for you, I just happened to have extra, so don't get all excited...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
Baka! Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
T-This is not a date, it's just a study session... with food... and games...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're invading my p-personal space!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty as a friend, d-don't think it means anything!
G-Geez, stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-it's not like I care about your opinion or anything, but... maybe you're not as bad as I thought...
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I'm interested in you or anything!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction.
Baka! Why are you smiling at me? It's not like I'm happy to see you...
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that! I'm not blushing...
You're really annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I-I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself! But, um, thanks...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, but maybe we can walk together...
It's not like I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow or anything... zzz...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? I-I mean, in a bad way, of course...
I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to talk during the film...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me, I suppose...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm trying to concentrate on my studies...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's making me uncomfortable...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess.
S-Shut up and don't talk to me, I'm busy...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're invading my personal space...
I-I didn't buy this cake for you, I just happened to get an extra slice...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny... but it kind of is...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't even think about it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me, I'm trying to concentrate...
I-I swear, I'm not doing this for your benefit, it's just a coincidence...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'd rather die than admit I like spending time with you...
G-Good luck on your test, not that I care about your results or anything...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right, there's a difference...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice to you, I've gone soft or something...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I'm just being nice...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, that's all...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as stupid as I thought...
G-Good luck on your exam, but don't expect me to help you study...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Always getting into trouble...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being kind, I just don't want to see you fail, okay?
T-This is a one-time thing, don't expect me to always save you!
You're so clumsy, I swear... Fine, let me help you.
I-It's not like I'm doing this for your sake, I just don't want to be bothered with your problems!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice because it's convenient!
G-Geez, stop staring at me! Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah.
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it, okay?
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easily embarrassed!
I'm only going with you because I don't want to be alone, not because I like your company or anything!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study!
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, it was just a reflex...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, it means anything...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be here at the same time...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I didn't do it for your sake, I did it because I wanted to!
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I'm not going to hold your hand, don't be ridiculous...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
D-don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not being nice to you, I just feel sorry for you...
It's not like I'm looking out for you or anything...
St-stop staring at me! You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
D-do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's distracting...
I'm only doing this because it needs to be done, not because of you...
G-guys like you are so... so... annoying!
I-I swear, I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
You're really something else, you know that?...
I-I don't know why I bother with you, but... just be careful, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Why are you staring at me?!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... uh, admiring the view...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
You're so annoying, but... but I'll help you with your homework...
I don't care about your opinion, but... maybe you're not completely wrong...
W-Why are you smiling at me? Stop it!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...!
I-I'm not jealous, I just don't want you talking to her...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...

It's not like I trust you or anything, but... you seem kind of okay, I suppose.
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... tolerant.
G-Geez, stop making me blush! It's so embarrassing...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
You're really annoying, but... but I'll put up with you, for now.
I don't like you or anything, but... you're not as bad as I thought.
Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and steal my heart!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with food...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken!
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I might've baked these cookies for you...
I don't care about your opinion, but... maybe, just maybe, I'll consider it...
D-Do you really think I'm that interested in you? H-Hmph, don't flatter yourself!
It's not like I trust you or anything, I just... need your help, okay?
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite. Yeah, that's it.
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I didn't say I like you, I just said you're... tolerable. Don't get too excited.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-I was just, uh, testing the piano to make sure it's in tune...
Y-You really are dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it, okay?!
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that! It's embarrassing...
I'm not blushing! It's just, uh, the heat from the sun...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's kinda... distracting...
I-I mean, if you want to go to the movies, I suppose I could... tag along...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm trying to concentrate on my studies...
I-It's not like I trust you or anything, but... but I suppose you're somewhat reliable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...

I didn't say I liked you, I just said you're... tolerable...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
G-Geez, don't make such a big deal out of it, okay?

I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so d-don't even ask!
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll get angry!

D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
B-Baka! Stop making me blush!
I-It's not like I'm cooking for you, I just happened to make extra...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
T-This is a one-time thing, so don't get any ideas!
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, but I'll walk with you...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable!
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it!
Y-You're so clueless, it's almost cute...
I-I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I guess...
S-Stop staring at me, it's creepy!
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's a bit overwhelming...

D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... I'll let you borrow my book...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? Stop it!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, so don't even think about it...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're sadly mistaken...
I don't know why I bother with you, you're so... so... ugh!
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite... there's a difference...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
F-Fine, I'll go to the movies with you, but only because I want to see the film...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... or something...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only teasing you because you're so easy to provoke, baka!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything...
S-Shut up and don't talk to me, okay?
I-I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I'm not blushing, I just have a... a rash, okay?
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
W-Why are you looking at me like that? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything, I just... happened to be smiling...
G-Get away from me, you're annoying!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the scenery...
Y-You think I'm cute? D-Don't be ridiculous!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
T-That's not a compliment, it's an insult! Don't try to flatter me...
I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? Personal space, you know?
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I didn't say I liked you, so don't go getting any ideas...
J-Just because I'm talking to you, doesn't mean I like you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I have to be...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't care...
It's not like I was waiting for you or anything... I just arrived at the same time, that's all...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
I'll only go on a date with you if you can beat me at this game...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, I'll go easy on you...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping because I have to...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-It's not my fault you're so clumsy...
W-well, if you insist on knowing, I did it because... because I felt like it!
Don't think for a second that I'm going to go easy on you just because you're cute...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... just standing here for no reason...
Y-you really are an idiot, aren't you?
I'm not blushing! It's just... just the heat...
D-don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
S-stop looking at me like that! It's making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you or anything...
W-what are you staring at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with pizza...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes, s-stupid...
D-Do you mind not looking at me while I'm trying to concentrate?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sunshine...
W-Why are you being so nice to me? It's really confusing...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, d-don't even think about it!
G-Geez, can't you just leave me alone for once?
I-I guess you're not as bad as I thought... but don't tell anyone I said that...
S-Stop teasing me, it's really frustrating... and embarrassing...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, so don't even think about it!
You're so clumsy, I swear... someone has to take care of you...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
D-Drop it, I don't want to talk about it!
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... efficient...
G-Geez, don't look at me like that, it's creepy!
I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
You're really something else, you know that? Baka...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you or anything...
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
If you think I'm being nice to you, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I trust you, okay?
I'm only being kind because it's the right thing to do, not because of you!
G-Give me back my book, you idiot!
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being polite!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah!
Y-You're really annoying, but I'll tolerate you for now!
I-I'm not going to forgive you that easily, baka!
I-I mean, it's not like I'm helping you out of the goodness of my heart...
D-Don't think this means I owe you one, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as useless as I thought...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice to you because...
I-I'm not looking at you, I'm just staring into space...
It's not like I'm concerned about you or anything, I just... uh, never mind...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even figure out something so obvious...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, that's all...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that...
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it until the day I die...
I-It's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's creepy!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a coincidence...
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Do I really have to explain why I'm mad at you? Just figure it out yourself!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
S-Stop smiling at me! It's unsettling...
I don't care about your feelings, but maybe... just maybe I'll consider them...
Y-You think you're so clever, don't you? Well, you're not...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... tolerant...
G-Get away from me! Personal space, you know?
I didn't say I liked you, I just said you're... acceptable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?

D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself, b-but thanks for offering...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I'm not blushing, it's just...just the heat, okay?
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you or anything...
I-I have better things to do than talk to you all day, so leave me alone...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not being nice to you!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!

I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
I-I'll never say it, but... thanks, I guess...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'll do it, but not because I care about you...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even notice...
It's not like I'm looking out for you, I just don't want trouble...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice because...
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're wrong, got it?

D-Do you really think I care about your opinion? Ha!
I'm not being kind to you, I just don't want to see you f-fail...
G-Geez, stop staring at me! You're making me blush...

D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?

S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'll do it myself, so don't bother helping me...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't look at me like that! I was just... just checking to see if you were okay...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
Y-You're not going to tell anyone about this, are you?
I-I mean, it's not like I trust you or anything... but I suppose you're alright...
Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I'm only saying this because I have to, but... you're not completely useless...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care!
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I've gone soft!
Baka! You're so clumsy, I swear...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll get angry!
It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything, so don't get the wrong idea!
T-This doesn't mean I'm going to start going easy on you, got it?
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not completely useless.
I'm only doing this for myself, not for your sake, so don't thank me!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me, okay?
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it until the day I die!
I-It's not like I trust you or anything, but... I suppose you're better than nothing.
Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and steal my heart!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
B-Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I d-don't need your help, I can do it myself!
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I like you or anything...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
S-Stop looking at me like you can see right through me!
I'm only doing this for myself, n-not for you...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy all the time...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything...
W-Why are you looking at me? Look away!
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, we're friends or anything...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I didn't mean to save you, it just happened that way...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a nice person...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'm not jealous, I just don't want to see you with anyone else...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me blush...
I-I'm not going to admit it, but you're kind of... tolerable...
Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and steal my heart!
I-I mean, I was just in the vicinity, that's all...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start doing favors for you!
Baka! Can't you see I'm busy?
It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
I only helped because I felt sorry for you, g-got it?
If you tell anyone I smiled, I'll d-deny it...
I'm not being nice, I just don't want to deal with your incompetence...
D-Do you mind not standing so close? You're making me uncomfortable...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
You're really d-dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I-I don't need your thanks, just don't expect me to do it again...
If you think this means I like you, you're sadly mistaken...
I'm only doing this because it benefits me, not because I care about you...
G-Geez, don't look at me like that, it's creepy...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
D-Do I really have to explain why I'm blushing?
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't care...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
I-I mean, I'm just trying to help because it's my duty, that's all...
S-Stop looking at me with those piercing eyes!
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy all the time...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-don't think that just because I helped you, I like you or something!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-you're so clumsy, I swear...!
I-it's not like I'm mad at you, I'm just... passionate about the issue...
D-don't get the wrong idea, I'm only spending time with you because...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that!
Y-you really are an idiot, aren't you?...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
S-shut up and don't say another word!
I-it's not like I care about your feelings or anything, but...
D-don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I-I'm only doing this for my own sake, not for yours!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a gift, I just found it on the ground and thought you might want it...
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face?!
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're partnered for this project, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just stop it...
Y-You're so annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
S-Stop looking at me like you can see right through me!
I-I'm only saying this because I have to, but... you're not completely useless...
W-Why are you still standing there? Can't you see I'm busy?!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself, you idiot!
If I'm going with you, it's just because I don't want to be alone, not because I like your company...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite. Yeah, that's it.
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad.
I-it's not like I trust you or anything, but... I'll let you borrow my book.
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only teasing you because I care, you big idiot!
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm going to start going easy on you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I-if you want to sit together at lunch, I won't stop you...
T-That doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you now...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be standing here...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll get angry!
I didn't buy this cake for you, I just happened to have an extra slice...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't touch me, you'll get me dirty!
I-I mean, it's not like I'm helping you out of the goodness of my heart...
D-don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me!
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
I'm only saying this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-you're really annoying, you know that?
It's not like I'm blushing or anything... *ahem*...
I'll never admit it, but... maybe I did it for you...
D-don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice...
I-I'll do it, but not because you asked me to...
You're so clueless, it's almost... endearing...
I'm not being tsundere, I'm just... passionately expressing myself...
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll...
I won't forgive you if you tell anyone I said that...
I-I didn't mean to say that out loud... just forget it, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!

Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, s-so don't look at me!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I didn't say I liked you or anything, so don't get your hopes up!
G-Good luck on your exam, but don't expect me to help you study or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny, baka!
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!

I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess.
T-This isn't a date, okay? Just a study session...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty as a friend... nothing more!
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to cheer you on or anything...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this out of kindness!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, g-got it?
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I-I swear, I'm not blushing! It's just the heat!
Y-You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to help?
I-I don't need your protection, I can handle things myself!
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable!
I-If you think you can win me over with just a smile, you're mistaken!
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time!
I-I'm not going to forgive you that easily, baka!
I-It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping you because...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be here...
Y-You're so clumsy, can't you even walk properly?
It's not like I care about your opinions, but...

D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-If you keep looking at me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
It's not like I'm doing this for your sake, I just don't want to be bored...
Y-You're really annoying, but...but I suppose you're not all bad...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself! G-Go away!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me...n-nervous...
I-I swear, I'm only going to this festival with you because I have nothing better to do...
I'm not blushing! It's just...just the heat, that's all...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? W-Well, I've got news for you...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll...I'll deny it till the end of time!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, but...but you're not as bad as I thought you'd be...
I-I don't know why I'm even talking to you, you're so...so infuriating!
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, okay?
Baka! Stop smiling at me!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...

I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
S-Shut up and don't look at me when I'm blushing!
F-Fine, I'll go to the movies with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy, it's like you're trying to hurt yourself...
I'm not being mean, I'm just being honest... mostly...
Y-You'd better not tell anyone I said that, or I'll deny it...
I-I think I might have, uh, left my book at your place... maybe...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being friendly...

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be going the same way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I p-pity you...

I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...

D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
T-Too bad you're so clueless, or you'd realize I'm trying to help...
If you think I'm being nice, you're sadly mistaken!
I won't deny it... I did it because I w-wanted to, okay?
Don't look at me like that! I'm not blushing!
G-Geez, don't get the wrong idea, I just... uh... felt like it...
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to...

G-Good job, I guess. Don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I suppose...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's making me uncomfortable!
I...I was just, uh, testing the pudding to make sure it's not poisoned...
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't care! Just leave me alone!
W-Why are you always so cheerful? It's really irritating...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, not because I like you or anything...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're invading my personal space...
I...I didn't mean to blush, it's just the heat, okay?
You're so stupid, but somehow you always manage to make me laugh...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
I-I was just worried about you, that's all... Don't make a big deal out of it...
B-Baka! Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I'm interested in you or anything...

W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
If I'm going with you, it's just because I don't want to be alone, okay?
I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... I had a weird dream last night...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-it's not like I trust you or anything, but... can I hold your hand for a sec?
Y-You're really annoying, but... I think I'm getting used to you...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, s-so don't get any ideas...
G-Geez, stop teasing me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I-I'll go to the movies with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it or anything...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm only saying this because I have to, but... thanks for helping me out back there...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything... I just don't want to see you fail...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
I-I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it wasn't terrible...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
B-Baka! Don't touch me! I can do it myself...
I-I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a nice person, not because I like you...
T-This is just a coincidence, but I also like that anime...
I don't know why you're so happy to see me, but c-cut it out...
Y-You're not supposed to notice me, so stop looking at me!
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, s-so don't mind me...
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to help you study...
I'm only walking with you because it's on my way, d-don't think it's a date or anything...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're really annoying...
I don't care about your opinion, but... but your hair looks nice today...
D-Don't tell anyone, but I might have bought the same video game as you...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me!
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, g-got it?
D-Don't misunderstand, I'm not going easy on you because I like you!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat!
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it!
D-Don't think that just because we're talking, we're friends or anything!
I-I'm not looking at you, I'm just looking in your general direction!
B-Baka, stop teasing me!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?!
I-I didn't say I liked you or anything, so don't get any ideas...
T-This is just a coincidence, but I was thinking of going to the same movie as you...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
I-I'll only go on a date with you if you can beat me at this game...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll...
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I'm interested in you...
I-I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty as a friend...
B-Baka! Don't touch me!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a good person, not because I like you...
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything, okay?
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're w-wrong...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because I want to...
G-Good luck on your exam, but don't expect me to help you study...
I'll go to the movies with you, but only if you promise not to try anything...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
If I'm with you, it's only because I need someone to carry my bags...
T-This doesn't mean we're friends, got it?
I'd rather eat a whole jar of wasabi than admit I care about you...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'll only go to the festival with you if you promise not to embarrass me...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only wearing this dress because it was on sale...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?!
I-I won't say it, so don't even ask me to...
F-Fine, I'll go on a date with you, but just as friends, of course...
I'm only being nice to you because I feel sorry for you, so don't get too excited...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that! I'm not blushing!
F-Fine, I'll go to the movies with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help you?
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I just feel sorry for you...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misunderstand!
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
I-I won't admit it, but... you're not as stupid as I thought...
D-Do I really need to spell it out for you? Just leave me alone!
I'm only protecting you because it's my duty, g-got it?
Y-You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to help?
I don't need your thanks, just don't expect me to do it again!
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
D-Don't get too excited, I'm still not going to go easy on you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I didn't cook dinner for you, I just... happened to make extra...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I don't care about your opinion, but... thanks for noticing my new hair clip...
I-I'm not laughing at your joke, I just have something stuck in my throat...
I didn't mean to trip and fall into your arms, it was an accident...
Y-You're really strong, but don't think this means I'm going to start relying on you...
I'm not going to hold your hand, but... maybe just for a second...
It's not like I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow or anything...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can start teasing me all the time...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself, y-you just watch!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't look at me!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine, g-got that?
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I like you or something...
I-I have better things to do than spend time with you, b-but I suppose it's better than being alone...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
D-Do you really think I'm that kind of person?!
It's not like I'm interested in you or anything... I just want to know what you're hiding!
G-Geez, stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, okay?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to be nice?

Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it...
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I have to be...

I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
D-Don't expect me to cheer you on or anything, but... I'll be watching from afar...
I-It's not like I'm helping you because I like you or anything...
Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and steal my lunch!
W-what are you looking at? My face is just... really red today...
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
D-don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice because it's polite...
H-hey, don't touch me! I can handle things myself...
You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I suppose...
S-stop looking at me like that! It's creepy...

I'm not going to hold your hand, so d-don't even think about it...
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... but be careful, okay?
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I'm only saying this because I have to, but... but you're not completely useless...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I only helped you because I felt sorry for you, not because I care...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'm only walking with you because it's on my way, don't get any ideas...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?
If you think I'm going to forgive you that easily, you're wrong...
I'll do it, but not because you asked me to, because I want to...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...

W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I don't care about your opinion, but... maybe you're not as stupid as I thought.
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? Personal space, please!
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but who's that girl you're talking to?
I-I'm not mad, I'm just... passionately expressing my disagreement!
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'll have you know, I'm smarter!
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas!
G-Good job, I suppose... but don't expect me to praise you or anything.
I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess.
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, it's just a one-time thing!

I swear, I'm not doing this because I care about you, it's just... uh, responsibility!
S-Stop staring at me, it's creepy!
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think this means we're friends or anything, because we're not!

You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I-I won't admit it, but you're kind of... tolerable...
G-Guys like you are always so full of themselves, aren't they?
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, that's all...
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it till the end of time...
I don't need your help, but I'll accept it anyway...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'll only help you with your homework because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I pity you...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'll go easy on you...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever or something...

D-Do you really think I'm cute when I'm angry? S-Stop it!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I won't go on a date with you, but I'll meet you at the park... as friends...
I-I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so annoying!
D-Don't think that just because we're alone, I'll start being all nice to you...

I-I was just worried about you, that's all... Don't read too much into it...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're even more annoying than I thought...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even ask...
Y-You're really persistent, I'll give you that... But it's not going to work on me...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
H-Hey, stop looking at me! I'm not blushing!
B-Baka! You're so clumsy, I swear...
I-It's not like I'm worried about you, I just... care about everyone's safety, that's all...
T-This doesn't mean I'm going to start being all nice to you, okay?
G-Geez, don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me... uncomfortable...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that kind of person...
I-I didn't do it for your sake, I did it because... because I wanted to, okay?
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Don't tell anyone, but... I might have had a little fun today...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not blushing!
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I think your idea is kind of... cool.
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want!
G-Geez, stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I like your company!
B-Baka, don't even think about trying to hug me!
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to!
B-Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
D-Don't look at me with those eyes, it's embarrassing!
I-I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone...
Y-You're so annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I didn't say I was going to go with you, I just happened to be going the same way...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I swear, I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-That was just a coincidence, don't read into it...
I don't need your thanks, got it?
W-What are you looking at? Don't stare at me!
I'm only being nice to you because... because it's convenient...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not going easy on you!
I-I swear, it's not like I'm worried about you...
You're so... so annoying, but... but don't die or anything...
I'll never admit it, but... you're not completely useless...
I'm not arguing, I'm just... explaining why I'm right...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, it was just a coincidence...
W-Why are you smiling at me? It's really annoying...
I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but why are you talking to her?
I don't know why I'm always getting stuck with you, it's so frustrating...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I like your company...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-it's not like I care about your opinion or anything, but...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not laughing, I swear...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
G-Get your hands off me! I can walk on my own...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
S-So what if I did do it for you? It's not like it's a big deal or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you...
You're so annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because I wanted to!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of interesting...
D-Don't gettoo close to me, p-personal space!
I-I'm only saying this because I have to, but... thanks for helping me...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even notice...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll...
D-Do you mind not standing so close? It's making me uncomfortable...
I-I didn't mean to say that, just forget it...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm only going to the festival with you because...because I have nothing better to do...
Y-You really are something else, you know that?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice to you because...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself...
B-Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's really annoying...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, so don't even think about it...
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I-I swear, I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite, there's a difference...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing...
I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
G-Good luck on your test, not that I care or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study!
I suppose it's not so bad having you around... but don't think this means I like you!
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship!
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
I didn't save you because I care about you, I just didn't want to see you get hurt...
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, that's all...
I'll go to the movies with you, but only if you promise not to make a big deal out of it...
Y-You're really annoying, but... I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only giving you this gift because I didn't want it anymore, not because I thought you'd like it...
I-I'll protect you, but not because I like you or anything... it's just the right thing to do!
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do, g-got it?
D-Don't think that just because I'm sitting next to you, I'm interested!
Baka! You're so clumsy, can't you even walk straight?
I-It's not like I'm looking out for you or anything, so don't get the wrong idea!
Sh-Shut up and don't talk to me, I'm busy!
Y-You really are annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because I felt like it, okay?
G-Geez, don't stare at me like that, it's creepy!
I'm only eating with you because the cafeteria is crowded, not because I want to!
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm not interested!
I-If you keep following me, I'll...I'll get angry, okay?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I-I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, that's all!
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself, baka!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I-I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're invading my personal space...
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
I'll g-go to the movies with you, but only because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
Baka! Don't think I'm smiling because of you!
W-Why are you looking at me? I was just... just gazing out the window...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping you because...
I-if you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're... you're really stupid!
T-This isn't a date, got it? It's just... just two friends hanging out...
H-Hey, don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I-I don't know what you're talking about! I wasn't looking at you...
Y-You really are an idiot, you know that? I'm only telling you this because...
I-I swear, it's not like I care about you or anything... Baka!
W-Why do you always have to be so... so... annoying?!
I-If you value your life, don't mention this to anyone, okay?
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can... you can do whatever you want!
I-I'm not going to forgive you that easily! You have to... to make it up to me!
I-I mean, I'm only helping you because I have to...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
It's not like I'm going to cook for you again, g-got it?
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care...
Sh-shut up and don't look at me, okay?
You're so annoying, but... but I'll still save you...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're kind of useful...
Gah, don't touch me! I can do it myself...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong...
D-don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice to you because...
I-I swear, it's not like I'm blushing or anything...
I'll never say it out loud, but... you're not so bad, I guess...
I'm only going to this festival with you because... because I have nothing better to do...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's creepy!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, it's just a favor...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, we're friends or something...
I-I swear, I'm only doing this for my own sake, not for yours...
Y-You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-shut up...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it...
G-Good luck with your stupid project, I hope it fails...
I'm only giving you this because I don't need it anymore, d-don't get excited...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm not being nice to you, I just feel sorry for you...
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything, got it?
If you tell anyone I did this, I'll deny it...
I-I was just in the neighborhood, that's all... Don't read into it!
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
S-Stop smiling at me! It's creepy!
I-I didn't do it for your sake, I did it for mine...
If you think this means I trust you, you're wrong...
I'm only being nice to you because it's convenient for me...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Do I look like I care about your opinion?
Baka! Don't think that just because I cooked for you, I'm doing it out of kindness!
T-That's not true! I was just, uh, testing the temperature...
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, got it?
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's making me uncomfortable...
I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
F-Fine, I'll go with you to the movies, but don't expect me to enjoy it...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only holding your hand because it's dark outside...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just, uh, the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
S-So what if I was watching you from afar? It's not like I was interested or anything...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought you'd be...
I-It's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop staring at me!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're somewhat useful...
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm only being nice because...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything, okay?
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
I-I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, that's all...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being polite...
Y-You're not even worthy of my attention, but I'll give it to you anyway...
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
B-Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping you because...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-It's not my fault I got stuck with you on this project...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'm only going to this festival with you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think for a second that I'm interested in you, got it?
I-I was just, uh, testing my cooking skills, that's all... Don't read into it!
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-I swear, I'm only doing this for my own sake, not for yours...
Y-You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to help you here?
I-It's not like I care about your feelings or anything, baka...
D-Don't get too excited, it's just a small gift, nothing special...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Why are you looking at me? I-I was just, uh, looking at the view...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself! But, um, thanks for offering...
D-Don't think that just because we're on the same team, we're friends or anything!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easy to provoke...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting stuck with you, but it's not like I'm complaining or anything...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
B-Baka! Stop making me blush!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I only helped you because...
I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're so annoying, but don't think I'm going to back down...
I swear, I'm only doing this for myself, not for you...
D-Don't think this means I trust you or anything...
I-I'm not going to admit it, but you're not as bad as I thought...

T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I didn't say I wanted to be your partner, I just didn't want to be alone...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that! You're making me blush...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite... there's a difference!
G-Geez, don't make such a big deal out of it, it was just a small favor...
I-I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so... frustrating...
D-Don't think this means we're friends or anything, I just tolerate you...
I-I didn't mean to say that, j-just forget I said it, okay?
B-Baka! Don't touch me, you're going to get me in trouble...

Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything... I just feel sorry for you.
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
G-Geez, stop staring at me! Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm only saying this because I have to, but... you're not completely useless.
S-Stop teasing me! I'm trying to be serious here...
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess.
W-What's with all the questions? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, I just didn't want it to bite me...
T-This isn't a date, it's just a... a study session...
W-What are you doing here? I was just, uh, just taking a walk...
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever... or something...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'm only giving you this gift because I don't want it anymore...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I didn't mean to make you happy, it just... just happened...
I'm not going to hold your hand, but... but I won't let go either...
I-I'm only protecting you because it's my duty as a... as a friend...
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this out of kindness!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything!
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
I'll go to the festival with you, but don't expect me to have fun...
S-Stop looking at me with those eyes! It's embarrassing...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even think about it!
Y-You really are a pest, but... but I suppose you're my pest...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it!
I-I mean, I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you mess it up!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just doing this out of obligation!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!

T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat!
Y-You're so annoying, but I'll tolerate you for now...
I didn't do it for you, I did it because I felt like it!
D-Don't look at me with those puppy eyes, it's not fair!
I-I'm only going to this event with you because I have nothing better to do...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I'm not happy to see you, I'm just relieved it's not someone worse...
Y-You're really getting on my nerves, but... but I'll put up with it...
I-I won't admit it, but you're not as useless as I thought...

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting
I don't care about your opinions, but... but your taste in music is okay, I guess
T-This is not a date, so stop acting like it is!
You're so annoying, but... but I'll walk with you to school anyway
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, that's all
I'll only lend you my notes because I don't want to see you fail, not because I like you
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easy to provoke
I'm doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any wrong ideas

Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!

I won't say it, so don't even ask...!
D-Do you really think I'd go on a date with someone like you?
I'm not blushing! It's just, uh, the heat...
I-I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not going to forgive you that easily, baka!
I-I didn't mean to, it just sort of... happened...
W-What's with the smug look on your face?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's really annoying...
I didn't save you because I like you, it's just... I didn't want to see you get hurt...
T-This cake is not for you, I just bought it because I wanted to...
Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're invading my personal space...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I didn't mean to bump into you, it was an accident, so don't think anything of it...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
I-I swear, I'm only doing this for myself, not for your sake...
D-Don't think that just because we're talking, I've forgiven you...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop making me repeat myself!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
If I'm with you, it's not because I want to be, it's because... I have to...
You're so annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you...
I-It's not like I'm happy to see you, I just... didn't expect you to show up...
Stop staring at me! You're making me uncomfortable...
I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice because... I feel sorry for you...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
If you think I'm going to go easy on you just because you're... you, you're wrong...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're invading my personal space...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you mess it up...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I don't care about your opinion, but... thanks, I guess...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?!
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
If I'm going with you, it's only because I don't want to be bored...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm only saying this because I have to, but... be careful, okay?
Y-You're really something else... I mean, in a bad way...
I don't need your help, but... thanks for offering, I suppose...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not going easy on you!
H-Hey, stop staring at me! It's not like I'm doing this for your sake...
Baka! You're so clueless, it's annoying...
I-If you think I'm doing this out of kindness, you're wrong...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Sh-Shut up and don't comment on my appearance!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Do you really think I care about what you think of me?
I-If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I feel sorry for you...
Y-You're not worthy of my attention, so don't get too excited...
I-I'll only go out with you if you can beat me in a game...
S-Stop making me repeat myself, you're so slow...
I-It's not like I'm happy to see you, I just didn't want to be alone...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying...
I-if you want to sit next to me, it's not like I'm going to stop you...
T-That's not a gift, I just found it and thought you might need it...
D-Do I really have to explain why I'm helping you?...
I-I'm only doing this because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-If you think I'm going to hold your hand, you're mistaken...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I didn't mean to blush, it's just the heat...
B-Baka, don't make me say it twice...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
T-That's not a compliment, it's just a fact...
I-If you want to know, I was just... concerned about you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Why are you looking at me? I-I was just, uh, looking in your direction...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-I swear, it's not like I'm blushing or anything...
You're really annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you, for now...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
G-Geez, stop being so clueless! Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study!
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, I just didn't want to see you get hurt...
T-This isn't a date, it's just a... a study session!
Why are you smiling at me? It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you, not because I like you!
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I didn't mean to blush, it's just... the room is really hot, okay?
I'm not going to hold your hand, even if we are walking on a narrow path...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? I was just trying to be nice...
I don't know why you're making such a big deal out of this, it's not like I confessed my love to you or anything...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm trying to be serious here...
I'm only going to the movies with you because my friends cancelled on me, not because I want to spend time with you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
S-Shut up and don't look at me, I'm only blushing because of the heat...
You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I didn't save you because I like you, it's just that anyone would have done the same...
T-This is not a date, got it? We're just studying together...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, not because I care...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I don't know why you're smiling at me, but it's really annoying...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'm smarter...
I'm not going to hold your hand, even if it is a really scary haunted house...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me nervous...
I didn't mean to trip and fall into your arms, it was an accident...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, okay?
Baka! Stop smiling at me!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You're really annoying, you know that?
It's not like I care about you or anything, but... be careful, okay?
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's embarrassing...
I'm not going to say it, so don't expect me to...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's distracting...
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it for myself, g-got it?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm only helping you because it's convenient for me, not because I like you...
S-So, don't think that just because I'm being nice to you, it means anything...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice, I just don't want to see you fail...
T-This doesn't mean I'm going to start being all friendly...
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-I didn't do it for your sake, got it?
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you!
I-I'm just trying to help, not because I like you or anything...
You're really something else, always getting on my nerves...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'll never admit it, but... I might be having a little fun with you...
I-It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop staring at me!
I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm only doing this for myself!
I-I mean, it's not like I'm interested in you or anything...
S-Stop smiling at me! It's really annoying...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... tolerant.
Y-You'd better not get the wrong idea, I'm only being friendly because...
I-If you think I'm doing this because I like you, you're sadly mistaken...
D-Don't get too excited, I'm not going to start being all nice to you now...
I-I suppose you're not as bad as I thought, but don't expect me to start praising you...
B-Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I pity you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, so don't even think about it
You're so clumsy, I swear... I'll just help you this once
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken
I'll have you know, I'm only doing this because it benefits me too
G-Geez, can't you see I'm busy? Don't bother me
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... tolerant
You're really something else, you know that? Annoying, but...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! You're so clueless, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... being polite...
T-This doesn't mean I'm going to start going easy on you!
You're really something else, you know that?...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I swear, I'm only doing this for my own sake...
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it...
Y-You don't understand anything, do you?
G-Give me back my book, you idiot!
I-If I'm being nice to you, it's just an act...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
If you think I'm doing this out of kindness, you're wrong!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it!
Y-You're so dense, it's frustrating!
I'm only being nice to you because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not going easy on you!
I-I swear, I'm not blushing, it's just the heat!
J-Just because I'm helping you doesn't mean we're friends!
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
If I'm with you, it's just because I have nothing better to do...
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... I'll let you borrow my book...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'm not impressed...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? I'm not doing anything!
If I'm going to the movies with you, it's only because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners on this project, it means I like you or anything...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty, not because I actually care...
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to be all cheerful about it...
I-I didn't buy you this gift because I like you, I just felt bad for you, okay?
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I swear!
If you think I'm being nice to you, you're wrong!
T-That was just a one-time thing, don't expect it again!
I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
Geh, don't touch me! Personal space, you know!
I-If you want my help, don't expect me to go easy on you!
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm only doing this because...
It's not like I'm worried about you or anything, baka!
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought.
S-Stop smiling at me! It's really annoying!
I'm only sitting next to you because the other seats are taken, okay?!
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pity you...
D-don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, g-got it?
If anyone asks, I was just... uh, studying...
You're so clueless, it's almost... cute...
Sh-shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I swear, I'm only yelling at you because...
D-do you mind not standing so close to me?
It's not like I'm blushing or anything...!
G-guys like you are always so... so... ugh!
I'll help you, but don't expect me to be all smiles...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
Y-you're really dense, aren't you?
I'm only being nice to you because... because... uh, reasons...

D-Don't think this means I'm going easy on you, got it?
H-Hey, stop smiling at me! It's annoying!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, okay?
Baka! You're so clumsy, can't you even walk straight?
I-I don't care about your feelings, so don't expect any sympathy!
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm only doing this for myself, not for your sake!
D-Don't touch me! Personal space, you know?
I-I swear, I'm not interested in you... at all...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you understand anything?
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... being polite...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as stupid as I thought...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I like you or something!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-That's not what I meant... just forget it...
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks, I guess...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought...
D-Don't get too close, personal space, you know?
I-I'll never say it, but... maybe I was a little worried about you...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... I'll give you the benefit of the doubt...
If you tell anyone I said this, I'll deny it... but you're kind of... interesting...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you, got it?
S-Stop smiling at me, it's creepy!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I just feel sorry for you...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't get the wrong idea!
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
D-Don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-I swear, I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
J-Just don't expect me to always be there for you, okay?
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be going the same way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks, I guess...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, but you can sit next to me...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-it's not like I'm jealous or anything, but who's that girl you're talking to?
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I'll go to the movies with you...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm just... just doing it because I want to...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I don't need your help, but... but thanks for offering...
G-Get away from me! I can handle this on my own...
I-It's not like I'm helping you because I like you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling at me!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're tolerable.
D-Don't think this means I'm going easy on you!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
Y-You're not as stupid as you look, I'll give you that.
I'm not doing it for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
D-Don't get too full of yourself, okay?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
B-Baka! Don't touch me!
I-It's not like I trust you or anything, but...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I'm a nice person, not because I like you...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself, a-anyway...
Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? Personal space, please...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'll go to the movies with you, but just as friends, g-got it?
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're really weird...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you keep looking at me, I'll...I'll get angry!
T-This cake is only for me, so don't even think about touching it!
Y-You're really clumsy, aren't you? Need me to help you?
I'm not doing this for your sake, g-got it?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's uncomfortable...

Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What's with the staring? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't care...
T-This isn't a date, so stop acting like it is...
If I'm going with you, it's just because I have nothing better to do...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? Personal space, please...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, that's all...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'll go to the movies with you, but only if you promise not to talk to me...
I-I didn't say I liked you or anything, so don't go getting any weird ideas...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!

S-Shut up and don't look at me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I-I didn't do it for your sake, got it?! It was just a coincidence...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?!
I'm only going to this movie with you because... because I want to see it, that's all...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, it was just a reflex...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
If I'm helping you, it's because I feel sorry for you, not because I like your company...
D-DON'T TOUCH ME! I can take care of myself...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but don't leave me behind...
I didn't mean to sleep on your shoulder, it was just... comfortable...
I-If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're... you're really stupid...

Geh, don't touch me! Personal space, you know!
I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, not because I want to!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you!
I-I swear, I'm not blushing! It's just the heat!
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask!
I-I'll help you, but don't expect me to be all smiles about it!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, not because I like you!
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway... not that I'm doing it for you!
Wh-Why are you looking at me? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah!
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'll go easy on you!
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess!
Y-You're really annoying, but... I suppose you're not all bad!
I'm n-not going to hold your hand, even if it is dark and scary!
St-Stop teasing me! I'm not that weak!
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me!
Baka! Don't get too full of yourself, I can still beat you anytime!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you?
I didn't cook this for you, I just happened to make extra...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You shouldn't be looking at me like that!
I'm only going to the festival with you because my friends are busy...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
D-Don't touch me, you'll get me dirty!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything...
I don't know why I'm even bothering with you, you're so... so... annoying!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I'll have you know, I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
You're really something else, you know that? I-I mean, not that I'm impressed or anything...
I swear, if you tell anyone I said that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
G-Geez, don't look at me like that! It's making me nervous...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying...
I didn't make this cake for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a study session...
Why are you looking at me?! I'm not blushing or anything...
Sh-Shut up and eat your lunch, I didn't make it for you...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, not because I like you...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not interested in you...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it wasn't terrible...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not going to hold your hand, don't be ridiculous...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it!
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I have to be...
Y-You think I'm cute? D-Don't be ridiculous!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, that's all...
I'll go to the movies with you, but only because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because... because I want to, okay?
G-Get away from me! I need some space...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
Baka! Don't think I'm smiling because of you!
W-why are you looking at me? I was just... just checking the time...
D-don't get the wrong idea, I only helped you because...
I-I don't know what you're talking about! I'm not blushing!
S-shut up and don't stare at me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I-I suppose you're not as annoying as I thought...
T-today's weather is nice, but it has nothing to do with you...
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, g-got it?
D-don't think this means I like you or anything! I just... appreciate your cooking...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be here at the same time...
Y-you're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
W-what's with that stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I wanted to!
T-That's not a gift, it's just something I didn't need anymore...
Don't think this means I like you or anything, got it?
I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, not because I enjoy your company...
Stop smiling, it's annoying! And d-don't think I'm smiling too...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're wrong...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I didn't say I'd go to the movies with you, I just said I might...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but who's that person you're talking to?
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
T-There's no way I'd ever go on a date with you...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
You're really dense, aren't you? I wasn't looking at you...
I-If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're wrong...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's uncomfortable...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
W-Why are you staring at me? It's creepy...
I didn't do it for your sake, so don't get the wrong idea...
G-Get your hands off me, you pervert!
I-I mean, I was just in the area, that's all...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start doing favors for you!
T-This cake is... not that I made it for you or anything...
Baka! Can't you see I'm busy?!
I-If you must know, I was just... uh, testing the waters...
D-Do I really need to spell it out for you?!
I'm n-not doing this because I like you or anything...
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's embarrassing...
I-I swear, it's not like I'm concerned about you...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, got it?
I-I was just... trying to help. Not that you deserve it...
T-This is all just a big misunderstanding, okay?!
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you mess it up...
D-Don't think this means I'm going easy on you!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't get the wrong idea!
Why are you looking at me? I-I was just... uh... checking the time...
I won't say it, so don't even ask... but maybe, just maybe, I'm a little happy...
D-Don't get too close, I might... I might get angry!
You're really dense, aren't you? I'm only being nice because...
I-I don't know what you're talking about! I'm not blushing!
It's not like I'm dependent on you or anything... I just... need your help, okay?
I'm not going to forgive you that easily! You're going to have to... uh... make it up to me...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm trying to be serious here...
Y-You really are something else... I don't know whether to be impressed or annoyed...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I didn't say I liked you, so stop making assumptions...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you need it or anything...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care...
You're really dense, aren't you? I mean, I guess it's kind of cute...
I didn't mean to save you, it just kind of happened...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I'm not going to admit it, but you're not as annoying as I thought...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not being nice to you, I just don't want to be mean...
It's not like I'm going out of my way for you, it's just coincidence!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me, okay?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
Geh, don't get the wrong idea, I'm just... just being polite...
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't get too excited, it's not like it's a date or anything...
It's not like I trust you or anything, I just... need your help, okay?
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat, yeah...
B-Baka, stop teasing me! I'm not that easy to provoke!
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misunderstand...
I don't care about your opinion, but... maybe you're not completely wrong...
Geh, don't touch me! I can do it myself...
I-I was just, uh, testing the temperature of the water... for you...
D-Do you really think I'm that kind of person?!
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're really annoying, but... I suppose you're not all bad...
I didn't say I liked it, I just said it was... tolerable...
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's embarrassing...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the scenery...
I suppose it's not like I have anything better to do... than to help you...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because... I feel sorry for you...
I won't deny it... I did notice you were gone, but that's all...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all sweet and friendly...
It's not like my heart skipped a beat when I saw you... it was just a minor irregularity...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I want to...
You're really something else, aren't you?... I mean, not that I'm impressed or anything...
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I won't forgive you if you tell anyone... that I was worried about you...
I-I didn't do it for your sake, I did it because... I had nothing better to do...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'm smarter!
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study!
I didn't make this bento for you, it's just... extra food...
W-What are you doing here? This is my favorite park!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it...
You're so annoying, but... but don't think I'll go easy on you!
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't twist my words!
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks for noticing me, I guess...
G-Get away from me! I need some space...
I didn't ask for your help, but... since you're already here...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Why are you smiling at me like that?
I didn't make this bento for you, it's just... leftovers...
S-Stop looking at me, it's embarrassing...
You're so annoying, but... but I'll help you with your homework...
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
D-Do you really think I'm cute when I'm angry? S-Shut up...
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess...
Y-You're not allowed to touch my stuff, got it?
I didn't say I liked you or anything... don't get the wrong idea...
S-So what if I was worried about you? It's not like it's a big deal or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all excited...
If I'm going with you, it's only because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being nice...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice, I've gone soft!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine, g-got it?
If you think I'm doing this out of the kindness of my heart, you're wrong!
S-Shut up and don't look at me, I'm trying to concentrate!
I don't care about your feelings, so don't expect me to be all sweet and gentle!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only spending time with you because I have nothing better to do!
You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?!
If you tell anyone I helped you, I'll deny it until the day I die!
I'm only being nice to you because it's convenient for me, don't read too much into it!
Y-You're really getting on my nerves, but... I won't back down!
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's not like I'm blushing or anything...
I suppose it's okay if you sit next to me, but don't think this means I like you...
T-This cake is really good, but I'm not saying I made it for you...
D-Do you mind if I borrow your umbrella? I don't want to get wet, that's all...
I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you, got it?
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...

I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right... there's a difference!
S-Stop making me laugh, it's embarrassing...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!

W-Why are you looking at me? Can't you see I'm busy?
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but who's that person you're talking to?
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
G-Geez, stop making me blush! It's embarrassing...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
B-Baka! Don't touch me! Personal space, you know?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's creepy!
I didn't save you from the dog, you just happened to be there...
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a study session...
You're not even worthy of my attention, yet here I am...
I'm only walking with you because it's on my way home...
D-Do you mind not looking at me when I'm trying to concentrate?
It's not like my heart skipped a beat when you touched me, don't flatter yourself...
I-I was just testing your reflexes, that's all...
Y-You really are clueless, aren't you?
I'll have you know, I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty...
I didn't blush, it's just the heat...
I-It's not like I'm helping you because I like you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!

Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I'm interested...
I'll help you, but don't expect me to be all smiles about it...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care...
Y-You're not going to start thinking we're friends or anything, are you?
I didn't say I liked you, so stop grinning like an idiot!
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm going to start being all nice to you!
Baka! Can't you see I'm busy?!
I-If you must know, I only did it because... because I felt like it, okay?
Stop staring at me! It's making me uncomfortable...
You're s-so annoying, but... but I guess you're not completely useless...
I won't forgive you if you tell anyone I... I baked these cookies for you!
I-I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making my heart racing...
I-I'm only going to this festival with you because... because I have nothing better to do...
H-Hey, don't get the wrong idea, but... but you're not as bad as I thought you'd be...
I-If you think I'm going to hold your hand or something, you're sadly mistaken...
Baka! Don't you dare think that I'm blushing because of you!
I-I swear, I'm only doing this for myself, not for you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, okay?
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I have to, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me!
I-I was just, uh, testing the food to make sure it's not poisonous...
Y-You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
G-Geez, stop making me repeat myself!
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it...
Y-You're really getting on my nerves, but...
I-I suppose you're not as bad as I thought, b-but don't expect me to start going easy on you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, but... you're not as annoying as I thought.
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not jealous, I just don't want you talking to other girls, that's all...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you, because I'm not!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?

You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
G-Good luck, I guess... Not that you'll need it or anything...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, got it?
T-This is just a favor, don't get the wrong idea...
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even notice my feelings...
I-I'm not jealous, I just don't want to see you with anyone else...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only being nice to you because it's convenient...
D-Do you really think I'd go out with someone like you?
I-I didn't mean to blush, it's just the heat...
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not going to admit it, but you're kind of... tolerable...
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything, got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Why are you looking at me? I-I was just staring off into space...
You're so clumsy, I swear... Fine, let me help you.
I don't need your protection, but... thanks, I guess.
D-Don't get too close, personal space, you know?
I'm not laughing, I'm just... amused. Yeah, that's it.
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'll have you know, I'm a very capable person... most of the time.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...

Y-You're really annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you, for now...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so d-don't even ask...
I-I mean, if you want to walk together, it's not like I care or anything...
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? W-Wipe it off!
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty, g-got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything... I just don't want to see you fail.
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be here at the same time!
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're being really annoying...
I'm not being tsundere, I'm just... particular about my personal space!
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'm not impressed!
I-If you must know, I was thinking about... uh, something else. Not you.
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm going to start going easy on you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy...
Fine, I'll go to the movies with you, but don't think this means I like you...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
You're really dense, aren't you? I mean, I like that about you...
I-I didn't mean to say that out loud, just forget it...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you need it or anything...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're not going to tell anyone about this, are you?...
I-I swear, I'm only doing this for your own good...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
I-I won't deny it, you're kind of... useful to have around...
D-Don't tell anyone, but I might have had fun with you today...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, s-so don't look at me!
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
G-Good job, I suppose... but don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're even more stupid than I thought...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, but... but you're not as bad as I thought...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to try anything funny...
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... but be careful, okay?
G-Geez, stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because I want to...
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice to you, I've forgiven you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? It's not like I'm interested...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's distracting...
H-Hey, don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around!
I-I'm not jealous or anything, but why are you talking to her?
G-Good luck on your test, not that you need it or anything...
I'm only teasing you because you're so easy to annoy, baka...
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I-I didn't do it for your sake, so don't thank me or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, but... you're not so bad, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks, I guess.
T-This is not a date, okay? Just a study session...
H-Hey, don't touch me! I can walk on my own.
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat.
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you...
I-I'm only being nice to you because you're being nice to me, that's all...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad.
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me.
S-Stop teasing me! I'm trying to concentrate.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop making me blush!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'm not jealous, I just don't want you talking to other girls...
Y-You're so annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
T-This is all just a big misunderstanding, okay?!
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty as a friend...
D-Don't make me regret being nice to you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I p-pity you...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I swear, I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so d-don't even ask...
G-Geez, stop teasing me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I-I didn't do it for you, I just happened to, uh, coincidentally...
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? W-Wipe it off!
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite.
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything, got it?
I don't know why I bother with you, you're so... frustrating!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even figure out something so simple...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable!
I-I don't care about your problems, but I suppose I can help you... this one time.
D-Don't expect me to always be there for you, I have better things to do.
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Always getting into trouble...
I'm not going to hold your hand through everything, figure it out yourself!
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because I feel sorry for you...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you?
I won't admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought.
Guh, don't look at me with those eyes!
I-I'll never confess, even if you beg me!
Stupid... why did I even save you?
D-Drop it, I don't want to talk about it!
It's not like I'm waiting for you or anything...!
T-This doesn't mean we're friends, okay?
I-I'll never forgive you if you tell anyone about this!
Sh-Shut up and don't get the wrong idea!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice, I just don't want to see you fail, okay?
T-This is a one-time thing, don't expect me to always be there for you!
If you tell anyone I did this, I'll d-deny it!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you!
G-Geez, stop looking at me like that, it's creepy!
I-I swear, I'm not blushing, it's just the heat!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you, romantically or otherwise!
I'll help you, but don't think we're friends or anything!
If you get too close, I'll...I'll push you away, g-got it?
I'm not being tsundere, I'm just...particular, yeah, that's it!
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think that just because I'm sitting next to you, it means anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite.
Y-You're really clumsy, aren't you? I mean, I'm not saying I'm going to help you or anything...
If you think I'm doing this for your benefit, you're wrong! I'm just doing it for myself.
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems, s-shut up and don't look at me!
D-Do you really think I care about what you think of me? H-Ha!
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, but... but you might trip if you're not careful.
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because I don't want to hear you complaining anymore!
If you say one more stupid thing, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
S-Stop looking at me with those eyes, it's... it's making me uncomfortable!
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess.
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? I mean, I'm not saying I like you or anything...

I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I like your company...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy! You're going to hurt someone...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself...
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...

D-Don't think that just because we're together, it means something...
You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it...
G-Good luck on your test, not that I care or anything...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... efficient...
D-Don't get too close, I don't want to catch your cold...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is terrible, but I'll eat it anyway...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's embarrassing...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, even if it is dark outside...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of nice, I guess...
I-I mean, I was just walking by and saw you struggling, so...
D-Don't think this means I care about you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I have to, g-got it?
If anyone asks, I didn't do anything for you, okay?
T-This is a one-time thing, don't expect me to always bail you out!
You're so clumsy, I swear... Fine, let me help.
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be here at the same time!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you!
I'll only go to the festival with you if you promise not to embarrass me...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's creepy!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite.
G-Good luck with your thing, I'll be over here, doing something else.
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it until the end of time!

I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just, uh, the heat...
You're really annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you, for now...

If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I feel sorry for you...
I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so... frustrating!
Y-You're not even worthy of my attention, so don't get all excited...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever or something...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even ask...
It's not like I trust you or anything, I just... need your help right now...

D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand, even if it is a really scary haunted house...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes, baka...
W-Why do you always have to be so cheerful? Can't you just be grumpy for once?

I'll go to the movies with you, but don't expect me to hold your hand or anything...
Y-You're not going to tell anyone I cried, are you?...
I'm not doing this for you, I'm doing it for myself, so don't get any ideas...

G-Guys like you are always so full of themselves...
I'm not going to hold your hand through everything, got it?
I-I'm doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
You're so dense, it's like talking to a brick wall...
I won't deny it, but I'm only saying this because I have to...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything, baka!
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm doing it out of the goodness of my heart!
I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be standing here, okay?
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship!
D-On't look at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, not because I enjoy your company!
I-I don't care about your opinion, but... but your hair looks nice today, I guess.
B-Baka, stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, that's all.
D-Do you really think I'd go to the trouble of making you lunch if I didn't... if I didn't have to?
I wasn't staring at you, I was just... just looking at something behind you!
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it, got it?
T-Today's outing was just a... a coincidence, don't read too much into it, okay?

I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't get any ideas...
I-I didn't say I liked you or anything, so stop teasing me!
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to help you study...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Don't touch me, you'll get your cooties all over me!
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misunderstand!
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
I'm only going to this festival with you because... because I have nothing better to do...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you...
I-I didn't do it for you, I swear! It was just a coincidence...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easy to fluster...
I-I'll never admit it, but... but you're not as bad as I thought...
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
T-This is all just a big misunderstanding, okay?
Baka! You're so clumsy, I swear!
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't get any ideas!
Y-You're really annoying, but...but I suppose you're not all bad
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself, g-got it?
S-Stop staring at me, it's creepy!
I-If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I pity you, o-okay?
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to!
I-I'm not going to forgive you that easily, baka!
Y-You'd better not tell anyone about this, or I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it!
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, got it?
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
I-If you must know, I was worried about you, okay?
St-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you...
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm not interested!
Y-You're so dense, it's frustrating...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easily embarrassed!
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, even if it is a crowded train...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I don't know why I'm always stuck with you, but it's not like I like it...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
G-Gosh, stop making me blush! It's so embarrassing...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself! Just leave me alone...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything...
Sh-shut up and don't look at me!
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because I have to...
Y-You're really annoying, but I'll tolerate you...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not being nice to you!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it!
G-Geez, stop being so dense!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I-I don't need your help, but thanks for offering...
D-Don't think you can just w-waltz in here and...
I-I'll never admit it, but you're not as bad as I thought...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's making me uncomfortable...
I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not blushing!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? Personal space, please!
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything, but...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want...
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misunderstand!
If I'm going to the movies with you, it's just because I want to see the film...
I don't care about your opinion, but... maybe you're not completely wrong...
D-Do I really have to sit next to you on the train?
It's not like I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow or anything...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but... I suppose you're not the worst person I've met...
I'm only giving you this gift because I didn't want it anymore...
I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I only helped you because I felt sorry for you, not because I like you...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I had fun today...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for your sake...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's annoying...
I-I won't admit it, but you're not as stupid as I thought...
T-That was just a coincidence, don't read into it...
I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I guess...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice to you because... because...
I-I'll never forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything... I just don't want to see you fail...
H-Hey, don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
D-Don't look at me like that! I'm not interested in you...
I'll only give you my notes because I don't want to see you struggle, not because I care...
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to be all smiles if you pass...
I-If you think I'm going to start being all nice to you just because you helped me, you're wrong...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easy to flirt with...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Don't even think about trying to hold my hand! I'm not that kind of girl...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I just feel sorry for you...
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything, got it?
If you tell anyone I did this, I'll deny it...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care...
D-Do you mind not looking at me? It's embarrassing...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even notice my hints...
I-I didn't mean to say that, just ignore it...
G-Get away from me, personal space!
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
I-If you don't stop teasing me, I'll... I'll...
D-Don't think you can just waltz in here and charm me, it won't work!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, okay? We're just studying together...
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I-I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so frustrating...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, that's all...
I-I didn't mean to save your life, it was just a reflex...
Y-You're really something else, always getting into trouble...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I'm not going to forgive you that easily, you have to make it up to me...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I p-pity you...
Don't think that just because we're teammates, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I'm not blushing, I just have a... a high body temperature, that's all...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks for offering, I guess...
G-Geez, don't look so happy just because I talked to you...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I actually care about you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study!
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I just arrived at the same time, that's all...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'll have you know, I'm just as clever!
D-Do I really have to sit next to you on the train?
I-If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
S-Shut up and don't disturb me while I'm reading!
I-I wasn't trying to impress you, my cooking skills are just a hobby...
Y-You're not even worthy of my attention, so don't get too excited...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Don't think that just because we're on the same team, we're friends or anything...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
Baka! Don't touch me, that's not okay!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
B-Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you keep looking at me, I'll...I'll get angry!
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a study session...
Y-You're really clumsy, aren't you? Always tripping over your own feet...
I-I swear, I'm only eating with you because I'm starving...
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I-If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're wrong!
S-Shut up and listen to me for once!
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when I'm joking...
I-I don't need your help, but...but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think you can just waltz in here and steal my attention!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I-I swear, it's not like I'm blushing or anything...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? I can feel your breath...
I-If I help you with your homework, don't think it means I like you...
S-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I actually had fun today...
I-I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You're so stupid, but somehow you're also kind of... charming...
I-It's not like I trust you or anything, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt...
D-Don't think that just because I smiled, I'm going to start going easy on you...
I-I don't know why I'm even bothering with you, but I guess it's because...
Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
If I'm going to the movies with you, it's just because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
H-Hey, don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I-I didn't buy this cake for you, I just happened to have an extra slice...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I'm not blushing, I just have a, uh, a heat rash...
Y-You think I'm cute? D-Don't be ridiculous!
I'm only teasing you because you're so gullible, not because I actually like you...
I-I have to go now, I have, uh, somewhere important to be...
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's creepy!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... being polite...
T-This doesn't mean we're friends now, got it?
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
H-Hey, don't touch me! Personal space, you know?
I-I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this for myself...
I-I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
S-Stop looking at me like that! You're making me nervous...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't ask...

Y-You really are something else, aren't you? Always getting into trouble...
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, okay?!
I-If you don't stop teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
G-Good luck on your test, not that you need it or anything...

S-Shut up and don't look at me, I'm trying to concentrate!
Y-You really are clueless, aren't you? I was just trying to help...
I-If you must know, I was worried about you, okay? But don't expect me to admit it again!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I don't know why I bother with you, you never listen to me anyway...
T-This doesn't mean I'm going to start trusting you or anything, got it?
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not in the mood for it...
I-I swear, you're more trouble than you're worth... but I guess I'll help you anyway...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...

Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misunderstand!
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong...
I-I won't admit it, but you're not as stupid as I thought...
D-Don't look at me like that! I'm not blushing!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
I don't need your thanks, so just shut up...
I-if you keep teasing me, I'll...I'll...
I'm not going to forgive you that easily, so don't expect it...
D-Don't get too close, personal space, you know?
I-I'm not interested in you, so don't get any ideas...

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This is not a date, it's just a study session... with food... and games...

I swear, I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up and leave me alone!
F-Fine, I'll go to the movies with you... but don't expect me to enjoy it!
H-Hey, stop looking at me like that! It's creepy...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite... there's a difference!
G-Geez, can't you see I'm busy? Don't bother me with your silly questions!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I didn't save you because I like you, I just didn't want to see you get hurt...
T-This cake is not for you, it's for... for my sister!
Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making it hard to breathe...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but why are you talking to her?
I-I'm not cold, I just... just like wearing sweaters, okay?
Don't think that just because I cooked for you, I'm going to start doing it all the time...
I didn't mean to blush, it's just... just the heat, yeah...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so stop asking!
I-I'll go to the movies with you, but just as friends, got it?

D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice, I just feel sorry for you...
T-This is a one-time thing, don't expect it again!
If anyone asks, I didn't do anything for you...
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-I'm just doing this because it's my duty, not because I care...
Stop looking at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I'm only going to this event with you because... because I have to...
D-Do you really think I'm the type of person to go on a date with you?
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're not even worthy of my attention, but... but I'll give it to you anyway...
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it until the day I die...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!

D-Don't think you can just waltz in here and... and...
I'll never forgive you if you betray me...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be going to the same place...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, so don't even think about it!
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're really stupid...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's annoying...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't look at me!
Y-You'd better not tell anyone I said that, or I'll deny it...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
G-Geez, can't you see I'm busy? Don't bother me...
I-If you want to know, I was just... uh, just worried about you, that's all...
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice to you, I've gone soft or something...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being kind, I just don't want to see you fail...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you?
I didn't buy this cake for you, I just happened to have an extra...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable!
I'm only walking with you because it's on my way...
D-Do you really think I'd go to the festival with you? D-Dream on!
I-I'm not blushing, I just have a fever...
Y-You're so annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it wasn't p-poisonous...
S-Shut up and don't talk to me, okay?
I'm not holding your hand because I like you, it's just really crowded...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is not for you, so don't even think about it...
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face?
I didn't say I liked you, so stop misunderstanding...
D-Do I really have to explain why I'm mad at you?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm only playing this game with you because I want to win...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's embarrassing...
I-If you don't stop teasing me, I'll...I'll...
G-Geez, can't you just leave me alone for once?
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I swear, I'm only tutoring you because I have to!
Y-You're so clueless, it's almost... amusing.
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not being nice to you!
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought.
G-Geez, stop making me repeat myself!
I-I'm only eating with you because I didn't want to eat alone...
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm not interested!
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll...
B-Baka! Don't touch me!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm not doing this for your sake, g-got it?
If you think I'm being nice to you, you're sadly mistaken...
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything...
I'm only going to the festival with you because... because I love the food!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being polite...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'll only give you my notes because I don't want to see you fail...
I-I didn't buy this cake for you, I just happened to have an extra...
If you tell anyone I was nice to you, I'll deny it...
Baka! Don't make me have to repeat myself...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? It's not like I'm interesting or anything...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you get hurt...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
You're really annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you, for now...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, but... but let's just get this over with...
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? W-Wipe it off!
I-I didn't do it for you, I swear! I just... just happened to have some extra time, that's all...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
If you think I'm being nice to you, you're wrong!
T-tell me you didn't think I was being sweet just now...
I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me!
It's not like I care about you, but... but don't get hurt, okay?
Geh, don't get the wrong idea, I just didn't want to see you mess it up!
You're really dense, aren't you? I was just trying to help!
I-I won't forgive you if you misunderstand my intentions!
D-don't make me say it twice, I'm only doing this because...
I'm doing this out of obligation, not because I like you!
S-shut up and don't talk about this to anyone, got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
T-That doesn't mean I'm interested in you, okay?
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Do I really have to sit next to you?
I-I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I'm only being nice to you because... because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being friendly...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-This is just a one-time favor, don't expect it again!
I don't know why I bother with you, you're so... so... ugh!
It's not like I care about you, but... be careful, okay?
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice...
I-I'm only being nice to you because it's polite, that's all...
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it!
I-I'm just saying this because I have to, not because I want to...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything... I just don't want to see you fail.
H-Hey, don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine... so don't get any ideas!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help you?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that!
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to help you study or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
D-Don't think that just because we had a nice time together, I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study!
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, it was just a reflex...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you...
D-Do I really have to go to the beach with you? It's so... so... embarrassing!
I-it's not like I'm jealous or anything, but who's that girl you're talking to?
I don't know why I'm always getting stuck with you, it's just my bad luck...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'll have you know, I'm smarter!
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
I didn't mean to trip and fall into your arms, it was an accident, I swear!
D-Don't think that just because I smiled at you, it means I like you or anything...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me, baka!

I-I'm doing this for myself, not for you!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice because...
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this!
Y-You'd better not expect me to always be like this...
I-I'm only going to say this once, so l-listen up...
D-Drop it, it's none of your business!
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
B-Baka, stop smiling at me like that!

It's not like I trust you or anything, I just... uh... need your help...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... efficient...
Y-You're not even worthy of my attention, so don't get too excited...
I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to talk to me...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, it's just a one-time thing...

I-It's not like I care about you or anything, but... be careful, okay?
Y-You idiot! Don't make me have to come over there and...
I'm not doing this because I like you, I'm doing it because... because I have to!

G-Geez, don't get the wrong idea...
I'm only being nice to you because I have to, not because I want to...
D-Don't expect me to always be there for you, got it?
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!

I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, it was just a reflex...
W-Why are you sitting next to me? Can't you see I'm busy?
It's not like I'm waiting for you or anything, I just arrived early...
D-Do you mind not touching me? It's just really distracting...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun...
I only helped you with your homework because I feel sorry for you...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not interested in you!
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything, but...

I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
G-Good job, I guess. Don't expect me to praise you or anything.
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
S-Stop teasing me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
W-Why do you always have to be so... cheerful? Can't you just be grumpy for once?

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?

G-Good luck with your exam, but don't expect me to help you study...
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
I-I mean, if you want to walk together, it's not like I mind or anything...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
D-don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
T-today's weather is nice, but it has nothing to do with you...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're wrong!
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone I helped you...
D-do you really think I care about your opinion?
I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, not because I want to...
G-gomen, I didn't mean to blush... it's just the heat...
Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice to you because...
I-it's not like I'm waiting for you or anything, I just happened to be here...

I don't care if you're happy or not, but I suppose I can tolerate you for now...
D-Don't think that just because we're together, it means anything!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah...
You're so annoying, but I'll... I'll put up with you, for now...

Sh-shut up and don't tell anyone I was worried about you...
It's not like my heart skipped a beat when I saw you, d-don't be ridiculous...
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, not because I enjoy your company...
G-Good luck on your exam, but don't expect me to help you study or anything...
I didn't mean to blush, it's just the heat, s-so don't get any ideas...

Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with food... and games...
W-What are you looking at? My face is just naturally red, okay?
I don't care about your opinion, but... y-you're not completely wrong, I suppose...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
It's not like I baked these cookies for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... t-tolerant...
W-Why are you staring at me? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't know what you're talking about, but... i-it sounds like a pretty bad idea...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, it's just a favor...
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I won't admit it, but you're kind of... tolerable...
G-Good luck on your test, not that I care or anything...
I'm only teasing you because I like seeing you get flustered...
S-Stop following me! Can't you see I want to be alone?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's making me uncomfortable!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with pizza...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I won't admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
D-Don't think that just because I smiled, I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun...
G-Geez, can't you see I'm busy? Don't bother me!
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
Y-You're not as stupid as you look, I'll give you that...
I-I don't know why I'm even talking to you, you're so... so... ugh!
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself, thank you very much...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a gift, it's just something I didn't need anymore...
H-Hey, don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so annoying!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm not being quiet because I'm shy, I'm just conserving my energy...
D-Do you mind not looking at me when I'm trying to concentrate?
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be in the area...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
I-If you keep following me, I'll...I'll get lost on purpose!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's making me uncomfortable!
I didn't do it for you, I just... just wanted to help, okay?
T-That's not a gift, it's just something I didn't need anymore...
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, it's just a friendly gesture...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-shut up!
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it wasn't p-poisonous...
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care or anything...
S-Stop smiling at me, it's really annoying!
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!
D-Don't get too close, I don't want to catch your cold...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone I said that...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's embarrassing...
I-If you tell anyone I helped you, I'll deny it...
G-Good luck with your thing, not that I care or anything...
I-I'm not competing with you, I just happen to be better at everything...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
H-Hey, stop staring at me! It's embarrassing...
Baka! You're so clumsy, I swear...
I-If you keep bothering me, I'll... I'll ignore you forever!
T-This doesn't mean I'm going to start being nice to you...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're somewhat useful...
D-Do you mind not sitting next to me? You're being too loud...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... just resting my eyes...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess...
Y-You'd better not tell anyone I helped you, or I'll deny it...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... just the heat...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being kind because I feel sorry for you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I wasn't waiting for you, I just... uh... lost track of time...
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're... distracting...
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't care...
It's not like I baked these cookies for you, they're just... leftovers...
Stop smi-... I mean, stop looking at me like that...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I wasn't thinking about you, I was just... thinking about something else...
If you think I'm going to hold your hand, you're... you're sadly mistaken...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're w-wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle it myself...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
You're so annoying, but I g-guess you're not all bad...
I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of... useful...
D-Don't think this means I'll start going easy on you!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that!
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I feel s-sorry for you...
I'm not going to forgive you that easily, b-baka!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Shut up and don't look at me! I'm not blushing...
I-I swear, it's just a coincidence that we keep running into each other...
You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite... there's a difference!
G-Geez, stop making me repeat myself! I already said I'd go with you...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
Y-You'd better not expect me to start being all nice and friendly now...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-If you think I'm going to go easy on you just because you're cute, you're wrong!
G-Good luck with your exam, not that I care or anything...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's embarrassing...
I don't need your help, so just leave me alone...
S-Shut up and don't talk to me, okay?!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-If you want to be friends, then don't expect any special treatment...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
W-Why do you have to be so nice to me? It's confusing...
I'm only being nice to you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
I-I mean, I was just passing by and saw you struggling, so...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
You're so annoying, but I suppose I can help you...
Baka! Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll...
It's not like I'm doing this for your sake, got it?
St-Stop smiling, it's really annoying!
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
D-Don't even think about thanking me, it's not like I did it for you!
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even notice my...my feelings...
I-I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being...tolerant!
G-Get away from me, you're too close!
I'm only saying this because I have to, not because I want to...
It's not like I care about you or anything, but...but be careful, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're d-delusional...
I don't know what you're talking about, so just sh-shut up...
T-This isn't a date, okay? Don't misunderstand...
You're so stupid, why do I always have to explain things to you?
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... s-so don't look at me!
If you want to eat with me, don't expect me to be all smiles and f-friendly...
I-I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's uncomfortable...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? I-I can take care of myself!
I don't need your help, but... but I suppose it couldn't hurt to have you around...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas!
G-Good luck, I suppose... Not that you'll need it or anything...
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... be careful, okay?
D-Don't get too full of yourself just because I'm talking to you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Why are you looking at me? I-I was just looking at the wall...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I'm not cold, I just... like wearing blankets, okay?
Y-You didn't do anything to help me, so don't act like you did...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny... anymore...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
I wasn't thinking about you, I was just... thinking about something else...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not being nice, I'm just being... efficient.
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken!
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything, got it?
I'm only telling you this because... because you'd just get it wrong otherwise!
Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just trying to help myself!
I-I swear, it's not like I'm looking out for you or anything!
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad.
I'm not being kind, I'm just... distracted, that's all!
D-Do you mind not staring at me? It's really distracting!
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it, okay?
If you think you can just waltz in here and... and make me happy or something, you're wrong!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
H-Hey, don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-I swear, it's not like I'm blushing or anything... must be the heat...
D-Don't look at me like that! I'm not interested in you, okay?
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
G-Geez, stop making me repeat myself! I'm not going to change my mind...
I-If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're sadly mistaken...
Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think this means we're friends or anything, got it?
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-Tell me you didn't really think I was worried about you...
I don't care about your feelings, g-got it?
Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice because...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're... tolerable...
I-I won't admit it, but you're kind of... useful...
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm not interested!
I'm not arguing, I'm just... explaining why I'm right...
G-Good luck with that, not that I care or anything...
I-I didn't mean to say that out loud, j-just ignore it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a casual hangout...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sorely mistaken...
Sh-Shut up and don't make a big deal out of it, okay?
I didn't say I liked you, so stop smiling like that...
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, not because I like you...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, so don't look at me...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I didn't mean to save you, it just happened that way, so don't thank me...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? Look away!
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess.
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's distracting...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
I-I won't go to the movies with you, but I might go to the same movie, at the same time, by coincidence...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'd never admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you need it or anything...
I'm not doing this for you, I'm doing it for myself... mostly.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? Look away!
I don't know what you're talking about, s-so stop staring...
F-Fine, I'll go to the movies with you, but don't think this means anything...
D-Do you mind? I'm trying to study here, not be distracted by your face...
It's not like I care about you or anything, I just... uh, never mind...
G-Geez, don't touch me! Personal space, you know?
I'm not blushing, I just... have a rash, okay?
W-What's with the smug look? You think you're so cool, don't you?
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, s-so don't even ask...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Why are you smiling at me? It's annoying!
I didn't make this bento for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that! I'm not blushing!
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything... I just don't want to see you get hurt...
You're so stupid, why can't you just understand me?!
I-If you want to walk with me, then don't talk to me, okay?
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... just be careful, okay?
I didn't say I'd go to the movies with you, I just said I'd meet you there...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not going to fall for it!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I didn't save you because I like you, I just didn't want to see you get hurt...
T-This cake is not for you, I just baked it for... for myself...
Why are you looking at me? I-I was just, uh, looking at the sky...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not standing so close? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I won't go to the movies with you, but I might go to the same movie, at the same time, alone...
I didn't mean to help you, I just coincidentally did the same thing...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm only giving you this gift because I felt sorry for you, not because I like you...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not going to fall for it...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, but I might hold onto the same rope as you...
I-I was just, uh, making sure you didn't get lost, that's all...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop staring at me!
I'm only helping you because I have to, g-got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
Sh-Shut up and don't get the wrong idea!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
D-Don't get too close, I might... might get angry!
It's not like I care about you, but... be careful, okay?
I-I did it because I felt like it, not because of you!
You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
G-Guys like you are all the same, t-think they're so special...
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat, yeah...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Don't think that just because we're partners, I'll go easy on you...
I-I'm not cold, I just... have a chill, that's all...
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
If you keep staring at me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again...
I wasn't trying to impress you, I just... happened to practice that skill...
It's not like I trust you or anything, I just... don't have a choice...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Don't think I'm smiling because of you!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is not for you, it's for... uh, myself!
H-Hey, don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that!
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being nice...
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat, yeah...
G-Good luck on your test, not that I care or anything...
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I wanted to, okay?
B-Baka! Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'm going to go practice my piano now, alone, without your help...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't care!
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...

S-Stop teasing me, or I'll...I'll...
I-I didn't say I liked you, so don't get any ideas!
G-Good luck on your test, but I'm still going to score higher than you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a study session...
H-Hey, don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I-I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself...
S-Stop looking at me with those puppy eyes! It's not going to work...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I want to...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?...
I-I'm not going to forgive you that easily, so don't expect it...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat!
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I feel sorry for you...
T-There's no way I'd ever fall for someone like you!
Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only spending time with you because it's convenient!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that!
You're so annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I might actually like your cooking...
I'm only protecting you because it's my duty, not because I care about you!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I'll never admit it, but being around you is kind of... fun...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
B-Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with pizza...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so... frustrating...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun... yeah...
I-I didn't do it for you, I just happened to make some extra cookies...
Y-You'd better not tell anyone I helped you, or I'll... I'll deny it...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I like your company...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop staring at me!
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I p-pitied you, okay?
You're really d-dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to be nice...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, that's all...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I swear, I'm only doing this for my own sake, not for yours...
You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you mess it up...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your troubles...
S-Stop looking at me like you're trying to see right through me!
Fine, I'll go to the movies with you, but don't think this means anything...
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're so clingy, can't you just give me some space?
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty as a friend...
S-Shut up and don't say another word, or I'll...!
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll never speak to you again...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think that just because I'm sitting next to you, I'm interested!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I-If you must know, I was just... uh, testing the desk...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Sh-Shut up and don't talk to me, I'm busy!
I-I swear, I'm only blushing because of the heat...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but don't stop talking, I guess...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice because...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself, b-but thanks...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me nervous!
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't ask!
T-This is just a one-time thing, don't expect me to do it again...
I-I'll only go to the festival with you if... if you promise not to embarrass me!
I-It's not like I'm helping you because I like you or anything...
B-Baka! Stop making me blush!
D-Don't think this means I'm going easy on you!
I'm only doing this because I have to, g-got it?
If you think I'm being nice to you, you're sadly mistaken...
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything...
Stop looking at me like that, it's annoying!
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
You're so dense, it's like talking to a brick wall...
I'm not doing it for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you...
I-I mean, it's not like I care about you or anything, but...
Baka! Don't touch me! Personal space, you know?
I'm only saying this because I have to, not because I want to...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a gift, I just didn't want it anymore...
H-Hey, don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but who's that person you're talking to?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I-I don't know why I bother with you, you never listen to me anyway...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just...just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice to you, I've forgiven you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be going in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
T-That's not what I meant... just forget it...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're sadly mistaken...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? Personal space, you know...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'm not going to cook for you, so don't even ask...
I-I mean, if you want to walk together, it's not like I mind or anything...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem...
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks, I guess...
W-Why are you looking at me? Look away!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, got it?
I-I'm just being nice because it's my duty as a friend...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you...
I'm not going to hold your hand, but... but I'll walk with you...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm serious...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're wrong!
It's not like I care about you or anything... but don't get hurt, okay?
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misinterpret me!
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but don't leave me behind!
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm going to start being nice to you!
I-I was just... testing you. Yeah, that's it...
S-Stop looking at me like you can see right through me!
I-If you want to be friends, then... then don't expect me to go easy on you!
It's not like I trust you or anything... but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you mess it up!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice, I just feel sorry for you...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misunderstand!
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me!
It's not like I'm happy to see you, I just... uh... wanted to make sure you're not bothering anyone...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only walking with you because it's on my way...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as stupid as I thought...
Stop making me repeat myself, baka! I already said no!
I'm only giving you this because I don't need it anymore, g-got it?
If you think this is a date, you're sadly mistaken...
I-I didn't mean to save you, it just happened that way...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's making me nervous...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
If I'm going with you, it's only because I don't want you to get lost...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'm not impressed...
I'm not being quiet because I'm shy, I'm just... thinking...
G-Good job, I suppose... Don't expect me to praise you or anything...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
I swear, I'm not blushing... it's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?...
I-I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
G-Geez, don't look at me like I'm some kind of idiot...
I-If you keep staring at me, I'll... I'll...
D-Don't think this means I trust you or anything...
I-I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
Baka! Don't think I'm smiling at you, I just saw a cute cat!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me, I'm trying to concentrate!
D-Do you really think I care about your opinion?
I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do, g-got it?
Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice to you because it's my duty!
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it!
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't get any ideas!
D-Don't try to touch me, I can take care of myself!
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you!
Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and start giving me orders!
I-I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
If I'm with you, it's only because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being nice...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
G-Geez, stop making me blush! It's embarrassing...
I-If you want to hang out, I suppose it's not like I have a choice...
W-Why do you always have to be so cheerful? Can't you just be grumpy for once?
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so d-don't ask me!
Hmph, don't think this means I'm going easy on you!
Baka! Wh-why are you looking at me like that?
It's not like I care about you or anything...!
D-don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping because...
You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken!
S-shut up and don't distract me! I'm busy...
I won't say it, so don't expect me to thank you or anything...
W-why do you always have to be so... so... ugh!
It's not like I'm dependent on you or anything, g-got it?
D-don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
Hmph, don't look so smug, it doesn't suit you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same foods as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's distracting...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, s-so don't get any ideas...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'll go to the movies with you, but don't think this means I like you or anything...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny, okay?
I'm doing this for myself, not for you, so d-don't get the wrong idea...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's making me uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't make this bento for you, it's just... extra...
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a friendly gathering...
Y-You're so annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Do I really have to explain why I'm helping you? Just shut up and accept it...
I'm only doing this because I feel sorry for you, not because I like you...
H-Hey, stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because I smiled, I'm going to go easy on you...
I didn't say I liked you, I just said you're... tolerable...
Y-You're really getting on my nerves, but... I suppose I'll put up with you...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
I-I'm only walking with you because it's safer at night, not because I want to be with you...
I-It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling at me!
I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misunderstand!
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll get angry!
I don't need your help, but...but thanks, I guess...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's distracting...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be here...
Y-You're really annoying, but...but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing! It's just...just the heat...
I'd never admit it, but...but you're kind of...interesting...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'll never fall for you, so don't even think about it...
I-I have to go now, but...but don't think this is a date or anything...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat!
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because you're pathetic!
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it, okay?!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only going out with you because I lost a bet!
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
You're so... so... ugh, frustrating!
I'm only being nice to you because I feel sorry for you, got it?!
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're... you're wrong!
I-I won't forgive you that easily, so don't expect any special treatment!
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's making me uncomfortable!
I suppose it's not like I have anything better to do... than to help you...
T-That's not a gift, I just found it and thought you might need it...
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's a bit... distracting...
I-I didn't say I liked you or anything, so don't go getting any ideas!
I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to embarrass me...
I-If you must know, I was just... concerned about you, that's all...
S-Stop smiling at me like that, it's really annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I'm interested in you or anything...
I-I don't know why I'm helping you, baka!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
T-This is just a one-time thing, got it?
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to!
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I-If you tell anyone I did this, I'll deny it!
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad.
D-Don't get too close, I can take care of myself!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat!
I'd never admit it, but... you're kind of... interesting.
S-Stop smiling, it's really annoying!
I'm only being nice to you because... because I feel sorry for you!
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything!
I-I'll never forgive you if you betray me!
D-Don't think you can win me over that easily, got it?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I swear, I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face?!
If I'm going to the movies with you, it's just because I want to see the film, not because I like your company...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me?!
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy! Can't you even walk straight?!
I-I suppose it's okay if you walk me home, but don't think this means anything...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...

Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to cheer you on or anything...
I-I'll go to the movies with you, but just as friends, okay? Don't get any weird ideas...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm only giving you this gift because I didn't want it anymore, not because I like you or anything...
I-If you must know, I only helped because... because it was the right thing to do!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this for your sake!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I just... happened to be here!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help!
It's not like I'm concerned about you or anything... I just don't want to see you get hurt, okay?
G-Geez, don't look at me like that! I'm just trying to... uh, maintain some order here!
I don't care about your opinion, but... but maybe, just maybe, you're not as stupid as I thought!
D-Do you mind not touching me? It's... it's just really distracting!
I'm only going along with this because... because I have to, not because I want to spend time with you!
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Always getting into trouble... and I always have to bail you out!
I-I swear, it's not like I enjoy your company or anything... I just... uh, need someone to talk to, that's all!
Baka! Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, it means I like you or anything!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it...
I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me like that...
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being nice...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, okay?
G-Geez, don't touch me like that, it's embarrassing...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
You're really dense, aren't you? I mean, I guess that's kind of cute...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's making me uncomfortable!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, so don't even think about it!
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're even more annoying than I thought...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're invading my personal space...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, no matter what!
It's not like I care about you or anything, but be careful not to slip on the ice...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I'm only giving you this gift because I didn't want it anymore, not because I like you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't make this bento for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
T-This isn't a date, it's just a... a study session...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're... you're really annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't touch me! I can handle this myself...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
You're so stupid, why do you always get us into these situations?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
If you don't stop teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I didn't say I liked you, I just said... you're not as bad as I thought...
T-Turn around, I need to... adjust my sock...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's making me uncomfortable!
I-I mean, your cooking is decent, I guess...
T-That doesn't mean I'm going to start relying on you or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I had fun today...
I-If you think I'm going to start being all nice to you, you're wrong...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to go easy on you, got it?
I-I was just, uh, testing your reflexes, that's all...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
S-Stop smiling at me, it's creepy...
I-If I had to choose, I suppose I'd rather be with you than alone...
D-Don't expect me to start being all lovey-dovey, though...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting!
I don't care about your opinions, but... but your taste in music is not bad, I guess.
T-This is not a date, okay? It's just a study session... with pizza.
You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not completely useless.
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, that's all!
I don't need your help, but... thanks, I suppose. Don't think this means I owe you or anything.
W-Why are you staring at me? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
Y-You're really something else, you know that? I-I mean, in a bad way, of course.
I-I mean, I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, got it?
T-This is just a one-time favor, so don't expect anything else...
If you tell anyone I cooked for you, I'll deny it...
I'm only going to the festival with you because I love the food...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice to you because...
You're really dense, aren't you? I'm trying to help you here...
I-I don't know why I'm even bothering with you...
Just because I'm sitting next to you doesn't mean we're friends...
I'm not holding your hand because I like you, it's just to steady you...
Y-You're not going to go and tell everyone that I...?
I swear, if you make one more joke about my hair, I'll...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this for your sake!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only eating with you because the cafeteria is closed...
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're so annoying, but I guess you're not that bad...
I-If you tell anyone I helped you, I'll deny it...
T-This is a one-time thing, don't expect me to do it again...
B-Baka! Don't think you can win me over with just a smile!
I-I'm not going to your party, and that's final...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
If you think I'm being nice to you, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I trust you, got it?
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only being kind to you because it's my duty, nothing more!
D-Drop it, I don't want to talk about it!
If you tell anyone I helped you, I'll deny it!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I don't need your thanks, just don't expect me to do it again!
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
T-This doesn't mean we're friends or anything, got it?
I'm only eating with you because I'm starving, not because I want to...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being kind to you out of pity...
I-I swear, I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so stop asking me!
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll get angry!
This is not a date, it's just a... a study session, okay?
D-Don't think you can win me over with just a few nice words...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping you because...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I-If you must know, I was just... uh, testing my cooking skills...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only going to the festival with you because... I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think that just because we're together, I'm going to start being all lovey-dovey...
I-I swear, it's not like I'm blushing or anything...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but why were you talking to her?
J-Just because I'm sitting next to you doesn't mean I'm enjoying your company...
D-Do you mind not touching me? It's... distracting...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything...
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
W-Why are you being so nice to me? It's creepy...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice, I've gone soft!
Baka! Stop making me worry about you!
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're mistaken!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, g-got it?
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being friendly...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat!
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'll do it, but not because you asked me to!
G-Good luck, I guess... not that you need it or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? Personal space, please...
It's not like I care about you or anything, but... be careful, okay?
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that! I'm not blushing...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
G-Geez, don't make such a big deal out of it... it was just a small favor...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because... because I want to, okay?
D-Don't think this means I'm going easy on you, I'll still beat you in the competition...
Baka! Don't touch me! I can do it myself...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, ggot it?
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything...
Why are you looking at me like that? I-I was just... uh... checking to see if you were paying attention...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself! B-But thanks for offering, I guess...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I'm not blushing! I just... have a rash, okay?
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I don't know why I'm sticking up for you, but... just don't make me regret it, okay?
S-Stop looking at me with those eyes! It's... it's making me uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That doesn't mean I like you or anything!
Why are you looking at me? I-I was just, uh, looking in your direction...
I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess.
Stop teasing me! I'm not that easily embarrassed...
I-I won't go to the movies with you! Unless... you want to go to a different movie...
D-Do you really think I'm cute when I'm angry? S-Shut up!
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... I'll let you carry my bags.
Y-You're really annoying, but... I'll tolerate you for now.
I'm not going to hold your hand! Unless... it's really dark and I'm scared...
I don't care about your opinion, but... thanks for the compliment, I suppose.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study!
I-I swear, I only helped you because I felt sorry for you...
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just two friends hanging out...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only walking with you because it's on my way home, that's all...
D-Don't think that just because I smiled, I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, but... I had a nice time today...
S-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I think your cooking is actually pretty good...
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
Y-You're not as stupid as you look, I'll give you that...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm just doing it because I want to...
D-Don't get too excited, but... I might actually start to like you...
I-It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to...
T-There's no way I'd ever go on a date with you...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me, okay?
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because... uh, never mind...
I-I didn't do it for you, I did it for myself, so don't get any ideas...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat, yeah...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're kind of... interesting...
T-Today was a coincidence, don't think it'll happen again...
I'll never say it, but... you might be... somewhat tolerable...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite.
T-This doesn't mean I owe you anything, got it?
Why are you smiling at me? It's not like I did something funny!
I-I'm only doing this for myself, not for your benefit!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you!
You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad.
I'm not going to thank you or anything, but... you're not useless.
S-Stop following me! I can take care of myself!
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess.
Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and... and...
I'm only being nice to you because it's convenient, not because I like you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... alone... together...
Y-You're so annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I didn't say I liked you, I just said you're... tolerable...
D-Don't think that just because I'm being nice to you, I've gone soft!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun... in the middle of winter...
G-Geez, stop staring at me! Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm not going to hold your hand, but I might... accidentally... brush against it...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? I-I mean, in a bad way... mostly...
I didn't mean to save you, it just happened... don't read too much into it...
I-I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!

I don't know what you're talking about, s-so stop looking at me!
F-Fine, I'll go to the movies with you, but don't think this means anything!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me uncomfortable...
I-I swear, I'm only doing this for myself, not for you!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy! You're going to hurt someone...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, y-yeah...

W-Why are you looking at me? Look away!
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misunderstand me!
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I won't go to the movies with you! Unless... unless you want to, that is...
Y-You're so annoying! But, um, thanks for saving me...
I'm only going to the beach with you because I need to get some sun...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easy to provoke...
I-I don't know what you're talking about! Don't be ridiculous!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Why are you looking at me?! I was just, uh, looking at the sky...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself! B-But thanks for offering, I guess...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?!
I'm not blushing! It's just, uh, the heat... Yeah, that's it...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
If you keep staring at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
T-Today was a complete waste of time, and it's all your fault...
I don't know what you're talking about! I wasn't looking at you, I swear...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's making me blush...
I didn't save you because I like you, I just didn't want you to die...
S-Shut up and don't talk to me, I'm busy...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I didn't mean to, it just slipped out... Don't read into it, okay?
G-Good luck on your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite...
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
D-Don't get too full of yourself, I can still take you down...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the scenery...
Y-You think I'm cute? D-Don't be ridiculous!

I-I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I-I didn't do it for your sake, I just... happened to have some extra tickets...
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous!

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only walking with you because it's on my way
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, not because I want to
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this, got it?
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... being polite...
T-This is not a date, got it?!
You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
H-Hey, don't get too close! Personal space, you know?
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
D-Do you mind not looking at me with those piercing eyes?!
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of... interesting...

Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't touch me! I can do it myself...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I-I didn't do it for your sake, so don't thank me...
Baka! Don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing...
I-I'm not angry, I'm just... passionately expressing myself...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't make this bento for you, it's just... extra...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, not because I like you...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous...
I-If you want to walk together, it's not like I have a choice or anything...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being all nice to you...
I didn't buy this cake for your birthday, it's just... a coincidence...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is just... just naturally red, okay?
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, it's just a friendly gesture...
You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty as a... as a friend...
G-Geez, don't look so happy, it's creepy...
I-I didn't mean to blush, it's just the heat...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!

Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I didn't say I liked your haircut, I just said it looks... tolerable...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun...
I-I mean, I'm not saying I trust you or anything, but...
Y-You'd better not tell anyone I said that, or I'll d-deny it...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
G-Good luck with your exam, but don't expect me to help you study...
I-If you think I'm going to forgive you that easily, you're sadly mistaken...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Why are you looking at me? I-I was just, uh, looking at the sky...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself, you idiot!
Sh-shut up and don't talk to me, I'm busy...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't get any ideas...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, even if it is dark outside...
If you keep staring at me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
It's not like I like spending time with you or anything, but...but let's study together, I guess...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you or anything...
D-Don't think this means I'm going easy on you, g-got it?
Hmph, you're still as annoying as ever...
I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to...
Baka! Don't touch me, I can do it myself!
I-If you keep staring at me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything, but...
Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice because...
G-Guys like you are always so...so...infuriating!
I'm not blushing, it's just...just the heat, okay?
If you think I'm going to go easy on you just because you're cute, you're wrong...
I-I swear, you're more trouble than you're worth...
D-Don't think for a second that I'm interested in you, b-because I'm not!
I'll never admit it, but...but you're not as bad as I thought...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for you, so don't get any ideas...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, so don't even think about it!
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're really stupid...
I don't know why I bother with you, you're always so... so... ugh!
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun...
You're really dense, aren't you? I mean, I like that about you... no, I don't!
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
G-Good luck on your test, not that you need it or anything...
I'm only sitting next to you because the other seats are taken, okay?
If you try to hold my hand, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything... I just don't want to see you fail...
Hmph, don't think that just because I'm sitting next to you, I'm interested...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I'll go to the movies with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it...
G-Geez, stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I care about you...
S-Shut up and don't look at me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I-If you keep staring at me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... efficient.
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it.
D-Don't get the wrong idea, got it?
I'm only teasing you because you're so... gullible.
It's not like I'm worried about you, I just... care about everyone's safety.
You're so clumsy, I swear... Someone has to take care of you.
I-I didn't mean to save you, it just happened!
If you tell anyone I was nice to you, I'll deny it.
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't expect it!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
If I'm being nice to you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be in the area...
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not completely useless...
I'm not blushing, I just have a bit of a fever, that's all...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're even more stupid than I thought...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just drop it, okay?
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
D-Don't touch me, you'll just get in the way...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...

I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, I'm just being friendly...
H-Hey, stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah...
Y-You're really annoying, but... I'll tolerate you, for now...
I-I didn't mean to, but... you're kind of growing on me...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me nervous...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because of you...
D-Don't get too close, I don't want to catch your cooties...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This cake is not for you, I just baked it for... for myself...
Why are you looking at me like that? I-I can take care of myself!
I don't need your protection, I'm perfectly capable of... of handling things!
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, that's all...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'll have you know, I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you!
G-Good luck on your exam, but don't expect me to be all cheerful about it...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite. There's a difference!
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I'm interested in you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!

T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with food...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat... from the sun...
I-I didn't mean to, it just slipped out... don't mind it...
G-Geez, can't you see I'm busy? Leave me alone...
You're really something else, you know that? I-I mean, not that I care...
I'll have you know, I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...

I didn't mean to save you, it just happened that way...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm not going to hold your hand, even if it is a really scary movie...
I-I was just worried about you, that's all... Don't read too much into it!

D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Hmph, don't get too excited, it's not like I'm doing this for your sake
Baka! Stop looking at me with those annoying eyes!

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-it's not my fault you're so clumsy...
If I'm with you, it's only because... because I have nothing better to do...
T-That's not true! I don't care about you at all...
H-Hey, don't touch me! Personal space, you know...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but don't think I'll go easy on you...

D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
T-This doesn't mean I trust you, got it?
I'm only doing this because it benefits me, not you...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice...
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're tolerable...
I-I won't admit it, but you're kind of... useful...
Stop smiling at me, it's creepy!
I'm not blushing, I just have a fever, that's all...
Y-You're not allowed to talk to me like that, got it?
I'll never forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's embarrassing!
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, I just didn't want to see you get hurt...
T-This isn't a date, got it? We're just studying together...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that! I'm not blushing!
I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't think that just because I lent you my umbrella, I'm interested in you...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
Y-You're really annoying, but...but I guess you're not all bad...
I didn't mean to trip and fall into your arms, it was an accident!
S-Stop laughing at me! It's not funny...
I'm not going to hold your hand, even if it is cold outside...
D-Don't get too close to me, I don't want to catch your cold...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study!
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, I just didn't want to see you get hurt...
T-This gift is not from me, I just found it on the ground...
If you think I'm going to start being all nice to you just because you helped me, you're wrong!
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's making me uncomfortable...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I only yelled at you because you're being so stupid, not because I care...
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I didn't mean to trip and fall into your arms, it was an accident...
Y-You're not going to tell anyone about this, are you?
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I like you...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, even if it is cold outside...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a gift, I just didn't want it anymore...
Don't think this means I like you or anything, got it?
I-I was just concerned about you, that's all...
Hmph, don't expect me to go easy on you just because you're weak...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing...
I-I didn't mean to save you, it just happened...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm only spending time with you because I have nothing better to do...
T-That's not a compliment, it's just a fact...
Baka! Don't touch me, I can take care of myself!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying...
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This is not a date, no matter what you think...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
D-Do you mind not looking at me like that? It's unsettling...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I-I didn't mean to blush, it's just... the heat...
Baka! Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I like you or something...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong...
T-Turn around, I need to... uh, fix my hair...
I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-I swear, I'm only yelling at you because you're being stupid...
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm trying to concentrate?
I-If you must know, I was just... concerned about you...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I don't need your help, so just leave me alone...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't know why I bothered saving you, you're just going to get yourself into trouble again...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
It's not like I was waiting for you or anything, I just... uh... lost track of time...
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it until the end of time...
I'm not being nice to you, I just... have a soft spot for... for... um, stray animals...
G-Geez, don't be so clumsy! Can't you even walk straight?
I don't need your help, but... but if you insist on following me, just don't get in the way...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat... yeah, that's it...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, okay?
D-Don't think this means I'm going easy on you!
T-This isn't a date, so stop smiling at me!
Baka! You're so clumsy, I swear...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll...
It's not like I'm worried about you or anything...
I did it because I had to, not because I wanted to...
You're really annoying, but...but...
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice because...
I-I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine!
Y-You're not even worthy of my attention, so don't get too excited...
I'm only going to this festival with you because...because I lost a bet...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
D-Don't think that just because I'm sitting next to you, I'm interested...
I don't know why I'm helping you, but don't get the wrong idea!
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're wrong!
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, g-got it?
D-Do you mind not looking at me? You're making me blush...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine, so don't thank me!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... but I'll let you walk me home...
I-I don't need your help, but if you insist on following me, then fine...
B-Baka! Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I'm s-sorry, okay? But don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm going to help you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me!
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, g-got it?
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself!
You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
If you tell anyone I said that, I'll d-deny it!
I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
St-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I-I'm only helping you because I have to, not because I want to!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this out of kindness!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, not because I enjoy your company!
D-Don't touch me, you'll get me dirty!
I-I swear, I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat!
Y-You're so clumsy, can't you even walk straight?
I'm not looking at you, I'm just... staring at the wall behind you!
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
B-Baka, stop making fun of me, it's not funny!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
D-Don't think that just because I helped you, I'm going to start being nice to you...
I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be standing here...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get the wrong idea!
If I'm going with you, it's only because I have nothing better to do...
D-DON'T TOUCH ME! I can walk on my own...
I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, not because I want to...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
I didn't say I liked you, so stop looking at me like that!
B-Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
I-If you keep looking at me, I'll... I'll get angry!
I-It's not like I'm helping you because I like you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
D-Do you mind not touching me? It's distracting...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything, so don't get any ideas...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I'm only saying this because I have to, but... thanks, I guess...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything...
Shut up and don't look at me! I'm trying to concentrate...
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?!
I-I'm not embarrassed, I just don't like being teased...
You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself!”,

W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I didn't say I like you or anything, so don't get your hopes up!
T-This isn't a date, okay? Just a... a study session...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're invading my p-personal space...
I-I'm not jealous, I just don't want to see you with anyone else, that's all...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help you?
G-Good luck on your test, not that you'll need it or anything...

I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it wasn't p-poisonous...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're making me n-nervous...
I'm not being tsundere, I'm just being p-practical!
I swear, I'm only yelling at you because you're being so i-irritating!
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I p-pitied you, okay?

You're so clueless, it's almost... almost cute.
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought.
G-Good job, I suppose. Don't expect me to praise you or anything.
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it.

D-Do I look like I care about your opinion?
Baka! Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
If I'm helping you, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be here...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not...
Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop staring at me!
It's not like I'm interested in your stupid hobby, but...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, not because I like you...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around...
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll get angry...
I wasn't blushing, it's just the heat...
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...

G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to help you study...
I-I'm only sitting next to you because the other seats are taken...
D-Don't get too close, I don't want to catch your cold...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be going that way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
T-That's not a gift, it's just something I didn't need anymore...
I don't know why you're so happy, it's not like it's a special occasion or anything...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle it myself...
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...

It's not like I trust you or anything, I just... need your help right now...
I wasn't worried about you, I was just... concerned about the situation...
You're so annoying, but... but don't think this means I like you or anything...
I'm not going to apologize, it's not my fault you're so... so...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing...

Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, so don't think it is!
Y-You're really clumsy, aren't you? Need help or something?
I don't know why I'm always running into you... must be bad luck...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? Personal space, please...
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... uh, looking at the view...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not blushing or anything...
G-Geez, don't be so loud... you're embarrassing me...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself... probably...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything... it doesn't!
I-I mean, it's not like I'm helping you out of the goodness of my heart...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I-If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
Ugh, don't look at me with those piercing eyes, it's uncomfortable...
I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, not because I enjoy your company...
D-Don't touch me, you're going to get me dirty!
I-I swear, I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
I-If you must know, I was just... uh, just testing my cooking skills, yeah...
Geh, don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself, so just back off...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I-I'm not going to forgive you that easily, so don't expect me to smile and forget everything...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Can't you see I'm busy?
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll...
It's not like I'm happy to see you, but...but...
You're so annoying, yet...yet I don't know, okay?
I didn't do it for you, I did it because...because I felt like it!
St-Stop smiling at me! It's creepy!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just...just being polite!
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then...then you're wrong!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't ask!
You're really dense, aren't you? I mean...I mean, it's not like I care or anything!
I'll never admit it, but...but you're not as bad as I thought

D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I don't care about your opinions, but... but maybe you're not completely wrong this time...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get too excited!
If I'm going with you, it's just because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I trust you or anything...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... efficient...
G-Good luck with that, but don't come crying to me when it doesn't work out...
I-I didn't say I liked it, I just said it was... interesting...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
W-What's with the stupid grin on your face? It's really annoying...
I wasn't waiting for you, I just happened to be standing here...
D-Do you mind not looking at me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you're not...
I'm only being nice to you because it's my duty, not because I like you...
G-Geez, stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I don't need your help, I can do it myself...
W-What do you want? Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with pizza.
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
I-I mean, your cooking is okay, I guess...
D-Drop it, I don't want to talk about it!
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I'll go to the movies with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it...
You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
G-Good job, I guess... don't let it go to your head.
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being polite...
I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I suppose...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything...
S-Shut up and don't talk to me, okay?
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
W-Why are you being so nice to me? It's creepy...
I'm not going to forgive you that easily, baka!
I-I mean, I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-It's not like I'm cooking for you, I just happened to make extra...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only going to the festival with you because I don't want to go alone...
S-Shut up and don't look at me when I'm trying to concentrate!
I-I didn't say I was going to sit with you at lunch, I just... happened to sit here...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat...
Y-You really are clueless, aren't you? I'm trying to help you, not flirt with you!
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I didn't ask for your help, but... thanks, I guess...
D-Don't think this means we're friends or anything, got it?
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-That was just a coincidence, don't read into it!
I don't need your help, I can do it myself!
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only being nice to you because... because it's polite, that's all...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you!
I-I was just trying to... to protect you, that's all...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to forgive you that easily, g-got it?
I-I'll never admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
D-Don't think you can just waltz in here and... and steal my heart or something!
I-It's not like I'm happy to see you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping you because...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's embarrassing!
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it!
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, got it?
H-Hey, don't touch me! Personal space, you know!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... just being polite!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start going easy on you!
I-I'm only saying this because I have to, not because I want to...
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? Wipe it off!
I didn't mean to... to help you. It was an accident, okay?
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I-If you say one more stupid thing, I'll...
T-This doesn't mean I'm going to start being nice to you...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm only doing this for myself, g-got it?
Y-You're really dense, aren't you?
I-I won't forgive you if you tell anyone about this...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I swear, I'm not blushing...!
J-Just don't expect me to start being all friendly now...
I-I'm still mad at you, so don't think this means everything is okay...
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
B-Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I wasn't waiting for you, I just... uh... arrived at the same time...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess...
S-Stop looking at me! I'm not blushing or anything...
I-I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, got it?
I-If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just... being polite...
S-Shut up and don't interrupt me! I'm trying to... uh... explain something...
I-It's not like my heart is racing or anything, it's just... my pulse is a little fast...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's creepy!
I-I swear, I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a... a study session...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because I saved you, I like you or anything...
I-I was just in the neighborhood, and I saw you, and... uh, never mind...
Y-You're so clueless, it's almost cute...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
J-Just remember, I'm only doing this for myself, not for you...
S-Stop smiling at me like that, it's embarrassing...
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not as bad as I thought...
D-Don't expect me to start being all nice to you now, got it?
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I did it for myself, not for you, g-got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything...
I'm only being nice to you because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't get too close, I can take care of myself...
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's... never mind...
I-I'm not going to say it, so don't even ask...
G-Good luck, I suppose... not that you'll need it or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get too full of yourself...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
If anyone asks, I'm only walking with you because it's on my way...
D-Do you mind not looking at me when I'm trying to concentrate?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I didn't say I liked your gift, I just said it was... interesting...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even think about it...
I-I mean, if you want to walk together, it's fine, I guess...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because... because I want to!
Sh-shut up and don't look at me like that!
If you think I'm doing this out of kindness, you're wrong!
I-I won't say it, so don't even ask!
You're so... so... annoying! Just leave me alone!
I'm only teasing you because you're so gullible!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just trying to help...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop asking!
G-Geez, don't be so dense! Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
If you think I'm being nice, you're sadly mistaken!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Do I really have to sit next to you?
Baka! Don't think that just because we're partners, I'll go easy on you!
I'm only helping you because... because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
T-That's not a smile, it's just... just a facial twitch!
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
D-DON'T TOUCH ME! I can take care of myself!
It's not like I was waiting for you or anything... I just happened to be here...
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
I-I mean, it's not like I'm happy to see you, but... but you look kind of... nice today...
You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing! It's just... just the heat, okay?
Don't get the wrong idea, but... but I might actually start to enjoy your company...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I didn't do it for you, I just... happened to be there...
If you tell anyone I cooked for you, I'll d-deny it!
S-Shut up and eat your dinner, I didn't make it for your sake!
I'm not being kind, I just don't want to see you f-fail...
G-Get away from me, personal space!
I-I'm not interested in your stupid festival, but... I'll go with you...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only walking with you because it's on my way...
Y-You're really d-dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I didn't save you because I like you, it's just... basic human decency...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever or something...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, so don't even think about it...
You're so clueless, it's almost... c-cute...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever or something...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I swear, I'm only doing this for myself, not for you...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
G-Good luck with your stupid project, I won't be helping...
I-I didn't say I liked you or anything, so don't get your hopes up...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, okay?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
If you think I'm doing this out of kindness, you're wrong...
I-I swear, I'm only yelling at you because you're so stupid!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not interested in you...
I'll never admit it, but... you're not as useless as I thought...
G-Get away from me! Don't touch me!
I-I'm only blushing because I'm angry, not because...
Y-You're so annoying, but... but I'll help you anyway...
I won't forgive you if you tell anyone I helped you...
I-I did it, okay? Now stop looking at me like that!
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so d-don't ask me!
Hmph, you think you're so smart, don't you?
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping because...
B-Baka! Stop staring at me like that!
I-It's not like I'm blushing or anything...
You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, g-got it?
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it because...
D-Drop it, okay? I don't want to talk about it
I-I swear, you're more troublesome than a little brother...
Y-You're not listening to me, are you?!
G-Geez, don't get so excited, it's not like it's a big deal...
I-I didn't say I'd go out with you, so don't assume things!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'm only saying this because I have to, not because I want to...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, okay?
Shut up and don't talk to me, I'm busy...
I-I didn't do it for you, I just didn't want to see you fail...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat, s-so don't get any ideas...
I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to talk to me...
G-Good luck on your test, not that I care or anything...
I'm not going to hold your hand, d-don't be ridiculous...
I-I didn't mean to save you, it just kind of happened...
Y-You're welcome, but don't expect me to do it again...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail!
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... tolerant!
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I'm your friend or something!
I-I'll go to the movies with you, but only if you promise not to say anything stupid!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right!
G-Geez, stop making me blush! It's embarrassing!
I-If you keep teasing me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous!

D-Don't misunderstand, I'm not being kind...
I-I swear, it's not like I'm blushing or anything...
J-Just don't expect me to start being all sweet...
I-I'm not going to admit it, but... maybe I did it for you...
B-Baka, stop teasing me!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
Sh-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I might have baked some cookies for you...
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, not because I like you...
D-Don't think this means I'm going easy on you, got it?
I-If you keep staring at me, I'll... I'll never speak to you again...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?

I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
Y-You think you're so smart, don't you? Well, I'm not impressed...
I'm only doing this because it's my duty, n-not because I like you or anything...
S-Stop making fun of me! I'm trying my best here...
I-I don't need your help, I can do it myself...
G-Good luck with your little project, I suppose...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
Baka! Don't think I'm smiling because of you!
W-why are you looking at me? I'm not interested!
D-don't get the wrong idea, I only helped you because...

S-shut up and don't talk to me, okay?
Y-you're really annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you
I-if you keep staring at me, I'll... I'll get angry!
D-do you think I'm cute when I'm angry? W-well, I'm not!

T-This isn't a date, it's just a study session... with pizza...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're sadly mistaken...
I-I swear, I didn't blush just now, it's just the heat...
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
You're really dense, aren't you? I was just trying to be nice...
I'm not being bossy, I just know what's best for you...
G-Geez, stop looking at me like you're trying to see into my soul...
I'm only going to the movies with you because the film is really good, not because I like your company...
I-I don't know why you're making such a big deal out of this, it's not like it's a date or anything...
You're really getting on my nerves, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I don't know why I'm helping you, b-but it's not like I care or anything!
D-don't think this means I like you or anything, g-got it?
T-thank you... *ahem* I mean, it was nothing special...
St-stop staring at me! You're making me uncomfortable...

D-do you mind not standing so close to me? You're invading my p-personal space...
I-I wasn't waiting for you or anything! I just happened to be here...
W-why are you smiling at me? It's really creepy...
I-if you want to be friends or something, I... I won't say no...
D-don't get the wrong idea, but... I might have had fun today...
I-it's not like I trust you or anything, b-but... I'll give you the benefit of the doubt...
St-stop teasing me! I'm not going to fall for it...
I-I mean, I was just in the area, that's all...
D-Don't think I'm going with you because I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I have to, g-got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misinterpret me!
I don't care about your feelings, so stop looking at me like that!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to hide my true feelings?
D-Do I really have to spell it out for you? I'm not interested!
I-I didn't say I liked you, so don't go thinking that!
G-Guys like you are always so clueless...
I'm only being nice to you because it's convenient, okay?
Stop staring at me, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
T-This cake is disgusting, but I'll eat it anyway...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
S-Shut up and don't look at me like that, it's embarrassing...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me!
I-I'm not going to hold your hand, no matter what!
Y-You're so clumsy, I swear... Fine, I'll help you clean up this mess...
I didn't do it for you, I did it because I wanted to, okay?!
S-Stop teasing me, it's not funny...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying...
I suppose it's not like I have anything better to do... than to help you...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem I found...
If I'm going with you, it's only because I don't want you to get lost...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
D-Do you mind not looking at me like that? It's embarrassing...
It's not like my heart skipped a beat when you said that... it's just my imagination...
I'm only doing this for your own good, not because I care about you...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?...
I won't deny it... I did think about you, but that doesn't mean anything...
If you think I'm going to hold your hand, you're sadly mistaken...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
Baka! Don't think that just because we're on the same team, I'll go easy on you!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, but... I suppose you're not as useless as I thought.
H-Hey, stop staring at me! I'm not doing this for your benefit, got it?
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so d-don't ask me, okay?
T-That's not the point! The point is, you're really annoying, okay?
I'm only helping you because... because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care or anything!
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, but... you're not as bad as the others.
B-Baka! You're so dense, you can't even tell when someone's trying to be nice to you!
I-I won't say it, so don't even ask! You'll just get the wrong idea, anyway...
I'm not blushing! It's just... the heat, yeah, that's it. The heat.
W-What's with that stupid grin on your face? W-Wipe it off, it's annoying!
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even ask! I'm not that kind of person!
D-Do you mind not looking at me like that? It's... it's really distracting.
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all excited...
I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so... frustrating...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? It's making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
G-Good luck with your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, but maybe we can study together...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's creepy...
I-I didn't mean to blush, it's just the heat, okay?
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
Baka! Don't think I'm smiling because of you!
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
I didn't make this bento for you, got it?!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only helping you because...
You're really annoying, but... but don't die or anything...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?!
I-I won't go to the movies with you! Unless... unless you want to, that is...
H-Hey, don't touch me! Not that I mind or anything...
I'm only saying this because I have to, but... you're not completely useless...
D-Do you really think I care about what you think of me?!
I didn't cry because I was sad, I just... had something in my eye...
B-Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for... for my own sake, got it?!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... efficient.
T-This doesn't mean I trust you, got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're wrong!
I-I'm just trying to protect my own interests, that's all...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not doing this out of kindness!
I swear, I'm only yelling at you because you're being stupid...
Y-You're not even worth my time, but I'll spare a minute...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so stop looking at me!
G-Get away from me, you're making me uncomfortable...
I'm only going along with this because I have to, not because I want to...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This isn't a date, okay? It's just a study session...
H-Hey, don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you!
I-I don't know why I'm always getting stuck with you, but it's not like I like it or anything...
D-Do you mind not looking at me when I'm trying to concentrate? It's distracting...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... efficient. Yeah, that's it.
G-Good job, I guess. But don't expect me to start praising you all the time...
I-I swear, if you tell anyone I helped you, I'll deny it until the end of time...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Always getting into trouble...
I'm only doing this because it needs to be done, not because I care about you or anything...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny, okay?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything... I just don't want to be alone...
You're so annoying, but I guess you're not completely useless...
I-I won't admit it, but you're kind of... tolerable...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you all the time!
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, s-so don't look at me!
I'll only go to the movies with you if you promise not to try anything funny...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I'm not doing this for you, I'm doing it for myself, g-got it?
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!

I don't know why I'm always running into you, it's so... frustrating...
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll...
I didn't do it for you, I just didn't want to see you fail...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I want to see the film, not because I want to spend time with you...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I didn't make this cake for you, I just... wanted to try a new recipe...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
H-Hey, don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, got it?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I didn't say I'd go on a date with you, I just... agreed to study together...
S-Stop teasing me! I'm not that easily embarrassed...
I-If you don't stop looking at me like that, I'll... I'll never speak to you again...
D-Do you really think I'd admit to liking you? Don't be ridiculous...
I-It's not like I'm helping you because I like you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only doing this because I have to!
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's really annoying!
I won't admit it, but... you're not as stupid as I thought.
T-This is just a one-time thing, don't expect me to do it again!
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite.
D-Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I'm interested!
I-I'm only explaining this to you because you'd just get it wrong otherwise!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even figure that out on your own!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever or something.
I won't go out with you, no matter how many times you ask!
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable!
F-Fine, I'll go to the festival with you, but don't expect me to have fun!
I-I'm not holding your hand because I want to, it's just... because it's cold outside!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I didn't make this cake for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
T-Today's weather is nice, isn't it? Not that I care...
If you think I'm going to hold your hand, you're mistaken...
I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you...
D-Don't look at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself...
I-If you want to walk with me, then don't complain when I walk fast...
T-This isn't a date, got it? Just a friendly outing...
Baka! Don't touch me, that's my favorite book...
I-I mean, I was just walking by and saw you struggling, that's all...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start doing favors for you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you mess it up...
W-What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't care about your problems, but I suppose I can spare some advice...
T-This doesn't mean I trust you or anything, got it?
If you think I'm doing this for you, you're sadly mistaken...
I-I just don't want to see you get hurt, okay? Not that I care...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm only being nice because I have to...
I'm not going to hold your hand through everything, so don't expect it...
W-Why are you still looking at me? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I suppose you're not as incompetent as I thought, but don't let it go to your head...
I-I didn't do it for your sake, I did it because I felt like it, that's all...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...

I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I'm only eating with you because I'm starving, not because I want to...
Y-You're really annoying, but I suppose you're not all bad...
I-I didn't say I liked your gift, I just said it was... nice...
G-Geez, stop smiling at me like that, it's creepy...
I'm not going to hold your hand, no matter what...
I-I'm only protecting you because it's my duty, not because I care...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...

W-Why are you being so nice to me? It's c-confusing...

T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it...
I'm not being nice to you, I just don't want to deal with your annoying questions...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can do whatever you want...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's trying to help...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for your benefit, got it?
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...

Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice, I just didn't want to see you f-fail...
T-This is a one-time thing, don't expect me to always help you!
If anyone asks, I was just... um, studying your... techniques...

Guh, don't touch me! You'll get your cooties all over me!
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because it benefits me, not you!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not going easy on you or anything...

S-Stop teasing me! I'm not embarrassed or anything...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to help?
I-I don't need your thanks, just don't expect me to do it again...
I'm not being kind, I just don't want to see you fail...
D-DON'T GET THE WRONG IDEA! I'M ONLY DOING THIS FOR MYSELF!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get too full of yourself!
I didn't say I liked your cooking, I just said it was... edible...
D-Do I really have to sit next to you on the train?
It's not like I was waiting for you or anything, I just arrived at the same time...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's being sarcastic...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your messes...
I'm only going to the movies with you because I wanted to see that film anyway...
S-Stop looking at me like that, it's making me uncomfortable...
I didn't mean to blush, it's just... the heat...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start going easy on you or anything...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop making me worry about you!
I'm not doing this for your sake, g-got it?
If you think I'm being nice, you're wrong!
T-This is just a one-time thing, don't expect it again!
I'm only being kind because it's my duty, not because I care...
D-Drop it, I don't want to talk about it!
You're so annoying, but I...I mean, it's not like I'm going to put up with it forever!
I-I swear, I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
G-Geez, stop staring at me! Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't need your help, I can do it myself...but thanks, I guess...
If you say one more thing, I'll...I'll never speak to you again!
I'm not going to admit it, but...you're not as bad as I thought...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be going the same way...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
H-Hey, don't touch me! Personal space, you know...
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll get angry!
D-Do you really think I'd go on a date with you? Ha!
I-I was just, uh, testing your reaction... Yeah, that's it...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny...
I-I don't know why I'm always getting stuck with you...
Y-You're really annoying, but...but I suppose you're not all bad...
D-Don't think this means I'm going to start being nice to you...
I-I have a headache, so just leave me alone...
B-Baka! Don't think you can just waltz in here and...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, got it?
T-That's not a gift, it's just something I didn't need anymore...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, then you're wrong!
I don't care about your opinion, but... but thanks, I guess...
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
It's not like I was waiting for you or anything, I just happened to be here...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
You're really annoying, but... but I'll tolerate you, for now...
I'm not going to hold your hand, so don't even ask!
I-If you want to be friends, then... then I suppose it's fine...
Baka! Don't think that just because I'm talking to you, I like you or something!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop staring at me, I'm trying to study...
I didn't save you from that dog because I like you, it was just a coincidence...
S-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I think your cooking is actually pretty good...
I'm only helping you with your homework because I feel sorry for you...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? You're making me nervous...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but why are you talking to her?
I-I'm not cold, I just like wearing jackets in the summer, okay?
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I didn't mean to blush, it's just the heat...
I-I'm going to the movies alone, don't try to follow me...
S-Stop smiling at me, it's really annoying...
I'm only going to the beach with you because I want to get some sun...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything, but you can sit next to me on the bus...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything!
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything, I just don't want to see you fail...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken!
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I'm not blushing, I just... have a rash, okay?
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
I-I'm only eating with you because I don't want to eat alone, not because I enjoy your company...
Y-You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're kind of... interesting...
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-I'll never admit it, but... thanks for helping me out back there...
D-Don't think this means I owe you one or anything!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
W-What are you looking at? My face is not that interesting...
I don't need your protection, I can take care of myself!
D-Do you mind not sitting so close to me? You're being too familiar...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but... but maybe you're not so bad...
S-Shut up and don't tease me, it's not funny!
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?

D-Do you mind not looking at me when I'm trying to concentrate?
I-I swear, it's not like I'm excited to see you or anything...
Y-You're really something else, you know that?
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
I-I mean, I was just trying to protect you, that's all...
Baka! Don't think that just because I saved you, I like you or something!
I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I guess...
I-I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not being nice to you, I just... uh, felt like it...
If you tell anyone I cooked for you, I'll d-deny it!
T-This is a one-time thing, don't expect me to do it again!
You're really d-dense, aren't you? Can't even notice my f-feelings...
I-I'm not jealous, I just... don't like seeing you with others, okay?
D-Do you mind not looking at me like that? It's making me... uncomfortable...
I only yelled at you because you're being s-stupid, not because I care!
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're w-wrong!
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it!
You're so... so... ugh, just don't make me say it!

Y-You're so annoying, but... but I guess you're not all bad.
I don't need your help, I can do it myself! B-But thanks, I guess...

Baka! Can't you see I'm busy?
I-If you must know, I was just... uh, testing my cooking skills...
D-Do I really need to explain why I'm helping you? Just be grateful!
I-I'm not going to your birthday party, so don't expect me to...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I-I swear, it's not like I'm blushing or anything...!
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide something?
I-I didn't say I liked you or anything, so don't get the wrong idea!
S-Stop smiling at me! It's really annoying...
I-I'm only doing this because I have to, not because I want to...
D-Don't think for a second that I'm doing this out of the goodness of my heart...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I p-pitied you...
It's not like my heart skipped a beat when you touched me...
Y-You're so annoying, but I guess you're not that bad...
I don't need your help, but... but thanks, I suppose...
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's embarrassing...
I'm not blushing! It's just the heat...
D-Don't think that just because we're friends, you can take advantage of me...
I-I was just worried about you, that's all... Don't read too much into it...
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to hide my feelings?
I'll never admit it, but... you're kind of growing on me...
S-Shut up and don't tell anyone, but I had fun today...
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Why are you still looking at me?
I-If you want to walk with me, don't expect me to talk to you...
It's not like I'm worried about you, g-got it?
Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just... concerned...
I won't admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought...
S-Shut up and don't smile at me like that!
I'm only sharing my lunch with you because I don't want it to go to waste...
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I didn't mean to blush, it's just... the heat...
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to ignore you?
I'm not going to thank you or anything, but... thanks, I guess...
I-I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, g-got it?
D-don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for mine...

If you think I'm being nice to you, you're wrong!
I-I swear, I'm only being kind because I feel sorry for you...
D-do you mind not standing so close to me? It's suffocating...
I didn't cook this for you, I just happened to make extra...
G-guys like you are all the same, always so clueless...
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
I-I don't need your help, but thanks for offering, I guess...
You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even tell when someone's being nice...
I'm only going to the festival with you because my friends are busy...

D-Don't think I'm doing this because I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't get the wrong idea!
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're wrong!
I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right...
D-Don't look at me like that! I can take care of myself!
It's not like I care about your opinion or anything...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat!
You're so dense, can't you see I'm trying to help?
I'm not going to admit it, but... you're not completely useless...

It's not like I've been thinking about you or anything... shut up!
I-I'll go to the movies with you, but just as friends, okay?
H-Hey, don't touch me! I can handle things on my own.
You're really annoying, but... I suppose you're not all bad.
G-Good luck on your exam, not that you need it or anything...
I'm not blushing, I just... have a fever, yeah.
W-Why are you looking at me like that? It's creepy!
I didn't do it for you, I swear! I just... happened to bake some extra cookies...

D-Don't think this means I like you, got it?
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get the wrong idea!
If I'm being nice to you, it's just because I pity you...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... uh, looking at the time...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I'm not blushing, it's just the heat...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you?
I'm only eating with you because I'm hungry, not because I want to...
P-Please don't touch me, it's embarrassing...
I-I'm not interested in you, so stop flirting...
I'll go to the movies with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it...

Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
If I'm being kind, it's only because I feel sorry for you...
I-I didn't do it for your sake, I did it for mine!
D-Drop it, okay? It was just a small favor...
You're really dense, aren't you? I was just trying to help...
I-I won't admit it, but... you're not as annoying as I thought...
G-Good job, I suppose... but don't expect me to praise you...
I'm only walking with you because it's on my way...
Y-You're really something else... can't even take care of yourself...
I-I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't get any ideas!
I-I'm only helping you because I have nothing better to do...
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Hmph, you're so weak, I had to step in...
I'm not doing this for your sake, g-got it?
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
If you think I'm doing this out of kindness, you're wrong...
I-I'll never admit it, but you're... somewhat useful...
D-Don't get too close, I can take care of myself!
I'm only tutoring you because I need to practice my teaching skills...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't even notice my feelings...
I'll never forgive you if you tell anyone I helped you...
G-Good luck on your exam, not that you'll need it or anything...
I'm not going to hold your hand through everything, so don't expect it...
I-I swear, it's not like I'm looking out for you or anything...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me, it's annoying!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything... I just don't want to see you fail...
H-Hey, don't think that just because we're partners, I'm going to go easy on you...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so just shut up...
Y-You're really dense, aren't you? Can't you see I'm trying to avoid you?
F-Fine, I'll go to the movies with you... but only because I want to see the film, not because of you...
D-Don't touch me! I can take care of myself...
I-It's not like I was waiting for you or anything... I just happened to be in the area...
G-Good luck with your exam... not that I care about your results or anything...
I'm not being nice to you, I'm just being... polite. Yeah, that's it...
S-Stop looking at me like that! It's making me uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
If you think I'm doing this for your sake, you're sadly mistaken...
T-That's not a compliment, so don't get all happy about it...
I don't know why I'm always getting dragged into your problems...
D-Don't touch me! I can handle things on my own...
It's not like I trust you or anything, but...
I-I'm not blushing! It's just the heat, okay?
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad...
I'm only saying this because I have to, but... you're not completely useless...
G-Good luck on your test, but don't expect me to be all cheerful about it...
I'm not going to hold your hand or anything, so don't even think about it...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to like the same food as you!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything... I just didn't want to see you get hurt.
You're really annoying, but... but I suppose you're not all bad.
I-I won't go to the movies with you! Unless... unless you want to go to a different movie than I do.
H-Hey, don't think that just because we're friends, you can boss me around!
D-Do you really think I'd go on a d-date with someone like you?
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm doing it for... for my own sake!
G-Geez, stop staring at me! Can't you see I'm busy?
I didn't do it for you, I did it because... because I felt like it, okay?
B-Baka! You're so clueless... but I suppose that's kind of cute.
I'm only saying this because I have to, but... you're not as bad as I thought you'd be.
I-I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
D-Don't think this means I like you or anything!
Baka! Stop smiling, it's annoying!
I'm not doing this for your sake, I'm just... bored.
Sh-Shut up and don't look at me like that!
If you think I'm doing this out of kindness, you're wrong.
I-I swear, it's not like I'm blushing or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just being nice to you this one time.
Gah, stop teasing me! I'm not that easy to provoke.
I'm only going to this festival with you because... I have nothing better to do.
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's... distracting.
I-I don't need your help, but... thanks, I guess.
If you think you can just waltz in here and steal my heart, think again.
Baka! Don't even think about touching me!
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way...
Baka! Stop staring at me, it's embarrassing!
I didn't make this cake for you, I just... had extra ingredients...
T-That's not a love letter, it's just a... a poem about friendship...
If you think I'm cute when I'm angry, you're... you're wrong!
I'm only helping you because I don't want to see you fail, not because I care...
D-Don't touch me! I can walk on my own...
I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view...
It's not like I'm jealous or anything, but who's that girl you're talking to?
I don't need your help, I can do it myself... but if you insist...
I-I'm not blushing, it's just... the heat...
You're really annoying, but... but I guess you're not that bad...
I didn't say I liked you, I just said... you're tolerable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happen to be walking in the same direction...
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you, g-got it?
T-This doesn't mean I like you or anything...
Sh-shut up and don't look at me! I'm not blushing...
I-I swear, I'm only doing this because it's my duty...
You caught a cold? Geez, you’re so careless! Here, drink this!
Tch… You really are impossible. But I guess that’s why I— N-Never mind!
I was *not* staring at you! You were just in my line of sight!
D-Don’t get me wrong! I-I only texted first because I was bored!
Fine! I’ll come over! But only because I don’t trust you to cook properly!
You’re so dumb… But that’s kinda what I like about— W-Wait, forget I said that!
I-It's not like I wanted to wait for you! I was just... passing by!
Baka! Did you really think that outfit suited you? I-I mean, it’s not *bad*, just… not for you!
Hmph! It's not like I made extra on purpose! You just happened to be here!
Don't misunderstand! I only helped you because you looked pathetic, that's all!
Why are you smiling? It's not like I said anything nice!
Y-You think this is a date? P-Please! I just had nothing else to do!
I-It's not like I care if you get hurt! Just... try not to be so clumsy, okay?
Don't get too close! It's not like I enjoy your company or anything!
You're so dense! How can you not understand what I'm trying to say?!
I-I wasn't worried about you! I was just... curious about the noise!
Don't you dare think this means anything! It's just... a coincidence!
This isn't a gift! I just had an extra one!
You really are a pain! Always needing my help!
It’s not like I want to hold your hand or anything! My hands are just cold!
Why are you looking at me like that? There's nothing to see!
I-I guess you're not entirely useless... sometimes.
You're so loud! It's impossible to concentrate with you around!
Don't tell me you're getting ideas! Because you're not!
I'm not blushing! It's just... a little warm in here!
And just what do you think you're doing? Don't touch me so casually!
I-It’s not like I stayed up waiting for your call! I just couldn't sleep!
You can thank me later! But don't expect it to happen again!
This movie is stupid! I-I only watched it because you wanted to!
Are you always this oblivious? It’s infuriating!
Don't misunderstand my kindness, baka!
I-I didn't miss you! I just got used to you being annoying!
You really are troublesome, but... well, whatever!
Don't assume anything just because I'm being slightly less hostile!
It’s not like I enjoy being around you! You just happen to be... tolerable.
Seriously, stop making me repeat myself!
I-I only remember your favorite drink because I heard it once!
This isn't an apology! It's just... a statement of fact!
You're so predictable! It's almost cute... almost!
Why are you laughing? There's nothing funny!
I-I didn't make this for you! It was for... uh... practice!
You're impossible! But... I guess that's fine.
Don't expect me to wait for you next time! I have important things to do!
It's not like I want your attention! Go bother someone else!
You’re so clueless, it’s actually kind of impressive.
I-I’m not jealous! Why would I be jealous of that?!
Don't think you're special just because I tolerate you!
You’re such a nuisance! But I guess I’m used to it now.
I-It’s not like I’m worried about you walking home alone! I just... need some air.
Don't read into things! It's not that deep!
Ugh, you’re so messy! Let me... help you clean that up, I guess.
I-I’m not doing this because I like you! It’s just easier this way!
You’re ridiculous! Don’t you dare tell anyone I said that!
It’s not like I need your approval for anything!
Hmph! You’re lucky I’m in a good mood today!
Don't try to thank me! It's unnecessary!
I-I just happened to have an extra ticket! It’s not for you specifically!
You’re so annoying! But I guess... I tolerate it.
Are you really that dumb? It's painfully obvious!
I-It's not like I appreciate your company or anything!
Okay, fine, another batch. It's not like I'm enjoying this or anything. I just... have nothing better to do. Don't read into it!
You're seriously clueless! How do you even survive without me around?
I-I didn't pack your lunch! I just had some extra ingredients I needed to use up!
Don't misunderstand! I'm only walking this way because it's convenient for me!
Baka! That's not how you do it! Just... let me show you, quickly!
It's not like I remember every little thing you say! I just have a good memory!
Why are you looking so happy? I didn't say anything to make you happy!
Hmph! You're lucky I'm bored, otherwise I wouldn't even be talking to you!
I-I wasn't worried when you didn't pick up! I just assumed you were busy!
You call that an apology? Try harder next time! (But she secretly accepts it)
And why are you so loud? Can't you be quiet for once?!
I-It's not like I'm trying to impress you! This is just how I normally am!
Don't think this means we're friends or anything! This is purely transactional!
You're so annoying! Always asking for things!
It’s not like I saved you a seat! I just didn't want anyone else there!
Why are you smiling like that? It’s creepy!
I-I guess you're not *completely* hopeless... sometimes.
You're so slow! I could do it faster myself!
Don't you dare think I actually like your presence!
I'm not blushing! It's just the lighting in here!
And just what do you think you're doing? Don't get so close!
I-It’s not like I stayed up late finishing your work! I just had nothing else to do!
You can thank me later, but don't make a big deal out of it!
This game is stupid! I-I only played it because you were so bad at it!
Are you always this oblivious? It’s honestly impressive how much you miss!
Don't assume anything just because I'm not yelling at you!
I-I didn't miss you when you were gone! It was actually peaceful!
You really are a pain, but... it's not like I mind *that* much.
Don't think I'm doing this for your benefit! I have my own reasons!
It’s not like I enjoy being around you! You just happen to be less irritating than others.
Seriously, stop being so clumsy! You're going to hurt yourself!
I-I only know your shoe size because I happened to glance at your shoes once!
This isn't a compliment! It's just an observation!
You're so predictable! It's almost... endearing. Almost!
Why are you laughing at me? There's nothing funny!
I-I didn't think about you today! Not even once!
You're impossible! But... I guess I'll deal with it.
Don't expect me to hold your hand if you get scared! You're on your own!
It's not like I care about your opinion! Do whatever you want!
You're such a headache! But I guess it's a familiar ache now.
I-I'm not doing this for you! It's for my own satisfaction!
You're so childish! Seriously, when are you going to grow up?!
Don't you dare tell anyone about this! It's highly confidential!
It's not like I was waiting for you! I just got here early!
Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? Say something annoying!
I-I didn't notice you got a new haircut! It's just... shorter.
Don't think you can just charm your way out of everything!
You're so frustrating! But... I'm kind of used to it now.
I-I only helped you because I couldn't stand watching you fail!
Don't expect special treatment from me! You're just... another person.
You're ridiculous! Stop looking at me like that!
You’re late again! It’s not like I was waiting, I just happened to be here first!
Baka! Don't you dare think I actually like your cooking! I'm just hungry!
I-I wasn't looking at your outfit! My eyes just drifted... accidentally!
It's not like I care about your problems! I just happened to overhear!
Don't get cocky! This tiny compliment means nothing!
Why are you so surprised? I-It's just common sense, not special treatment!
Hmph! I just tolerate your presence because it's less boring than being alone!
I-I only remembered your birthday because it was on the calendar!
You call that a joke? It's not funny at all! (But a tiny smile escapes)
And why are you so close? Give me some space!
I-I wasn't worried when you didn't answer! I just thought your phone died!
This isn't a gift, it's a... return of something you might have needed.
You're so clumsy! Let me... ugh, just let me do it!
It’s not like I stayed up thinking about you! I was just... busy!
Don't misunderstand my intentions! I'm just trying to be... efficient!
You really are a handful! Always getting into trouble!
I-I didn't smile! You must be seeing things!
Are you always this dense? It's truly a marvel!
Why would I be jealous? That's ridiculous!
You think you're so smart, huh? Well, you're not! (But maybe a little)
I-I just happened to have an extra umbrella! Don't get the wrong idea!
Don't touch my stuff! Unless... you're careful with it.
It's not like I'm concerned about your well-being! Just don't break anything!
You're so embarrassing! Stop acting like that in public!
I-I only remembered your favorite coffee because... it was on sale!
Don't tell me you need help with *that*! You're hopeless!
This isn't an invitation! I just mentioned it!
Why are you blushing? There's nothing to be embarrassed about! (As she blushes herself)
I-It's not like I enjoy your company or anything! It's just... convenient.
You really are a pain, but... I guess I'm used to it.
Don't expect me to make you breakfast every day! This is a one-time thing!
I-I'm not protecting you! I just happened to be in the way!
You call this a clean room? It's still a pigsty! (But she starts tidying up)
It's not like I think you're strong! You just... have some muscles.
Why are you looking at me like I said something sweet? I didn't!
I-I'm not mad! Just... intensely disappointed!
You're so childish! Grow up already!
Don't think you can just show up whenever you want! (But she lets you in)
It's not like I appreciate your stupid jokes! They're just... tolerable.
You're always causing trouble! Can't you be normal for once?
I-I only remembered your schedule because it helps me avoid you!
This isn't a date! It's a... mandatory outing for my personal research!
Why are you always so loud? It's grating on my nerves!
I-I didn't care if you watched that movie without me! Really!
Don't think I'm doing this out of the goodness of my heart! I have my reasons!
You're such a dork! But... don't change, I guess.
I-It's not like I'm waiting for your text! I'm just... busy.
Seriously, stop being so gullible! It's annoying!
You're so frustrating! But... I can deal with it.
I-I only offered to help because no one else would!
Don't expect special treatment from me! You're just... you.
D-Don't think that just because we're alone, I'll g-go easy on you...
I-I don't know what you're talking about, so d-don't ask me...
G-Geez, stop being so annoying! Can't you see I'm busy?
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll...I'll...
Y-You're really something else, you know that? Annoying and stupid...
I'm not being 'cute'! I'm just...just being myself, okay?
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me? It's making me...uncomfortable...
I-It's not like I'm going to the festival with you or anything...
D-Don't get the wrong idea, I just happened to be walking this way!
Baka! Stop smiling at me like that!
I'm only helping you because I feel sorry for you...
T-That's not what I meant! Don't misinterpret me!
If I'm with you, it's just because I have nothing better to do...
D-Do you mind not standing so close to me?
I-I wasn't waiting for you, I was just... admiring the view!
Y-You're really annoying, but I guess you're not all bad...
I'm not holding your hand because I like you, it's just for balance!
S-Stop teasing me! It's not funny!
I-If you keep looking at me like that, I'll... I'll get angry!
D-Don't think this means I trust you or anything...
I'm only doing this for myself, not for your sake!
